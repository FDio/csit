      "message": "Alright, I am confused.\nIt is possible that existing tests do not really care what IP4 value us used here. But PAPI should care, at least with respect to value size. IP4 address should be 4 bytes.\nWith .packed it is 4 bytes indeed, but with str it is more. I have two runs, test succeeds both with string [1] and binary [2] form (search for lb_conf).\n\nNaively, I would expect PAPI to refuse the long string form. Is there some smart conversion feature in (VPP python code part of) PAPI I am not aware of?\n\n[1] https://logs.fd.io/production/vex-yul-rot-jenkins-1/csit-vpp-perf-verify-master-2n-skx/1064/archives/log.html.gz#s1-s1-s1-s1-s1-t1-k3-k2\n[2] https://logs.fd.io/production/vex-yul-rot-jenkins-1/csit-vpp-perf-verify-master-2n-skx/1066/archives/log.html.gz#s1-s1-s1-s1-s1-t1-k3-k2",
