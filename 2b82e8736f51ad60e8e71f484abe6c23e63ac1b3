      "message": "There is a bit of history missing here.\n\nThe original purpose for having separate main \u0026 oper CSIT branches was to ensure VPP patches were tested using a CSIT branch that had been verified to pass all tests using a known good VPP git commit id [0].  This mechanism is meant to isolate CSIT changes from VPP changes such that root cause analysis can be focused on either VPP or CSIT as appropriate.  Also, it was originally conceived with the understanding that a majority (ideally all) of CSIT tests would be run prior to pulling a new oper branch and that the results would be the same as with the previous CSIT oper branch used to test [0].\n\nIt is not clear to me how this safe-guard is to be achieved without oper branches.\n\n[0] https://github.com/FDio/csit/blob/master/VPP_STABLE_VER_UBUNTU_FOCAL",

      "message": "I fully agree with Dawe comments. \n\nWithout oper- we would not be able to validate and verify stability of CSIT code changes to protect trending and \nVPP voting.\n\nTox is not even close to sufficient validation mechanism. It is acting only as linter to check namely job_spec, copyright_year, gpl_license, line_length, doc, pylint, autogen (some of them are not voting). And CRC checking\nis not meant to protect VPP rather opposite.\n\nIt is also not true that vppdevice was created afterwards as we had from day 0 the VIRL voting functional tests.\n\nIn this patch there is misleading summary of a history, as per Dawe\u0027s comments, but also wrongly captured\npurpose of Stable VPP Version, protection of the trending and more (e.g to easily revert to previous CSIT \"version\"\nby removing affected oper-branch). This misunderstanding then creates an impression that oper-branches are not\nneeded, while there is a lack of proposal how to create safe-guard onwards.\n\nThis leaves me no option other then -1.",
