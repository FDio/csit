      "message": "After a quick look at docs/lab/testbed_specifications.md I decided it is not obvious enough to see which hardware is really used for perf tests.\nSetups marked as WIP are used (3n-tsh, 1n-tx2 for device), setups marked as VERIFY are not used (2n-ps1, 3n-rng).\n\nI was thinking about pointing to job template instantiation [0], but once again we would need to update the commit reference each release.\n\nSo I decided to simply remove the list. Reference at line 6 should give more info anyway.\n\n[0] https://github.com/FDio/ci-management/blob/478ab7e8f488f143d3d2a5f9b04e9e09cd131699/jjb/csit/csit-perf.yaml#L101-L140",
