Overall removing those tests LGTM, subject to those tests living in other testbeds, specifically:\n- Would we have memif LXC running (or attempting to run) anywhere after this change?\n- Would we have GTPU HW running anywhere after this change?\n- Would we have vm testpmd tests running anywhere after this change?",

      "message": "The answer to all three questions is \"no\". Not in coverage tests, but a small subset of them is still in iterative (and daily/weekly).\n\nThe motivation for their removal is that they keep failing for a very long time (few releases). The second option is to fix them, but I have been reporting these issues again and again and nobody cares.\n\nI am also thinking of removing the majority of 9000B tests for the same reason.",
