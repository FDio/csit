Jumpavg library
===============

Origins
-------

This library was developed as anomaly detection logic
for PAL_ (Presentation and Analysis Layer)
of CSIT_ (Continuous System and Integration Testing)
project of fd.io_ (Fast Data), one of LFN_
(Linux Foundation Networking) projects.

In order to make this code available in PyPI_ (Python Package Index),
the setuputils stuff has been added,
and the code has been moved into a separate directory_,
in order to not intervere of otherwise tightly coupled CSIT code.

Usage
-----

TODO.
