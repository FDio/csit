Multiple Loss Ratio Search library
==================================

Origins
-------

This library was developed as a speedup for traditional binary search
in CSIT_ (Continuous System and Integration Testing) project of fd.io_
(Fast Data), one of LFN_ (Linux Foundation Networking) projects.

In order to make this code available in PyPI_ (Python Package Index),
the setuputils stuff has been added,
but after some discussion, the export directory_
is only a symlink to the original place of tightly coupled CSIT code.

Change log
----------

0.3.0: Migrated to Python 3.6, small code quality improvements.

0.2.0: Optional parameter "doublings" has been added.

0.1.1: First officially released version.

Usage
-----

TODO.

Operation logic
---------------

See `IETF draft`_.
