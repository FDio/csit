Multiple Loss Ratio Search library
==================================

Origins
-------

This library was developed as a speedup for traditional binary search
in CSIT_ (Continuous System and Integration Testing) project of fd.io_
(Fast Data), one of LFN_ (Linux Foundation Networking) projects.

In order to make this code available in PyPI_ (Python Package Index),
the setuputils stuff has been added,
and the code has been moved into a separate directory_,
in order to not interfere with otherwise tightly coupled CSIT code.

Usage
-----

TODO.

Operation logic
