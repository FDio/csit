Data will be fetched automatically as they come into DB.\n\nPlots will be pre-defined but custom queries are possible, so marketing does not need to ask.\n\nFurther reducing non used functions like COP (see vpp-dev) will be removed so we will save some time on execution.\nFully aligned 2n/3n tests with only IPsec running on 3n-skx/hsw, but code that can run anywhere.",
