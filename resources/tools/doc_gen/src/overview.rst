CSIT Description
================

#. Development of software code for fully automated VPP code testing,
   functionality, performance, regression and new functions.

#. Execution of CSIT test suites on VPP code running on LF FD.io virtual and
   physical compute environments.

#. Integration with FD.io continuous integration systems (Gerrit, Jenkins and
   such).

#. Identified existing FD.io project dependencies and interactions:

    - vpp - Vector Packet Processing.
    - ci-management - Management repo for Jenkins Job Builder, script and
      management related to the Jenkins CI configuration.

Project Scope
-------------

#. Automated regression testing of VPP code changes

    - Functionality of VPP data plane, network control plane, management plane
      against functional specifications.
    - Performance of VPP data plane including non-drop-rate packet throughput
      and delay, against established reference benchmarks.
    - Performance of network control plane against established reference
      benchmarks.
    - Performance of management plane against established reference benchmarks.

#. Test case definitions driven by supported and planned VPP functionality,
   interfaces and performance:

    - Uni-dimensional tests: Data plane, (Network) Control plane, Management
      plane.
    - Multi-dimensional tests: Use case driven.

#. Integration with FD.io Continuous Integration system including FD.io Gerrit
   and Jenkins

    - Automated test execution triggered by VPP-VERIFY jobs other VPP and CSIT
      project jobs.

#. Integration with LF VPP test execution environment

    - Functional tests execution on LF hosted VM environment.
    - Performance and functional tests execution on LF hosted physical compute
      environment.
    - Subset of tests executed on LF hosted physical compute running VIRL
      (Virtual Internet Routing Lab).
