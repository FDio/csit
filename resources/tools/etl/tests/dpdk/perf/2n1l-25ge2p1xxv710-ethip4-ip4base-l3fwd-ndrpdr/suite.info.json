NDR and PDR are  discovered for different Ethernet L2 frame sizes using MLRsearch  library.\nTest packets are generated by TG on  links to DUTs. TG traffic profile contains two L3 flow-groups  (flow-group per direction, 253 flows per flow-group) with all packets  containing Ethernet header, IPv4 header with IP protocol=61 and static  payload. MAC addresses are matching MAC addresses of the TG node  interfaces.",
