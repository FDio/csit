Temporary notes, to be deleted.

FIXME: Start describing the chosen algorithm.

The real classifier is written, and it seem to work correctly.
The real tests will need data from PAL.

Current simulator first generates the extected partition,
and compares its bit content with non-partitioned population.
That should predict whether the full detection algorithm
will consider this partition to represent an anomaly
(without detailing how would the algo find this partition).

Current simulation results:
10 samples, 9 subsamples, <1 sigma jump:
 1357 rounds isolated detected 0.0434782608696 averaged detected 0.0140014738394
10 samples, 9 subsamples, no jump:
 5893 rounds isolated detected 0.0 averaged detected 0.000339385711862

The snip below was caused by raduis wrongly being equated to stdev.

In current patch, the information content only detects
when average jumps by ~1.5 stdevs. Not sure why.
Either I have a bug, or I have some wrong assumption about
multi-dimensional Euclidean geometry.

By the way, the information content is quite good
at detecting partitions with differing stdevs,
so it is doing at least something right.
Just for comparable stdevs it seems to be giving longer streaks
less bits per sample than I would have thought.

When we have seen some values x_i from assumedly
Gaussian distribution with unknown parameters,
there is an (un-normalized) prior,
and posterior probability density for next value x is proportional to:
  (x*x*X0s -2*x*X1s +X2s +(X0s*X2s - X1s*X1s))^(-X0s/2)
Where X0s is number of previous values, X1s is their sum,
X2s is sum of squares, in other words,
  Xks = Sum[(x_i)^k]
Ignoring normalization constant, this becomes
  (1 + y*y)^(-n/2)
where
  y = (x - m) / Sqrt[D]
with
  n = X0s
  m = X1s/X0s
  D = X2s/X0s - m*m
Mathematica says that normalized y density is
  (1 + y*y)^(-n/2) * Gamma[n/2] / Sqrt[Pi] / Gamma[(n-1)/2]
Distribution function (for arithmetic coding for least message length) is
  y * Gamma[n/2] * Hypergeometric2F1[1/2,n/2,3/2,-y*y] / Sqrt[Pi]  / Gamma[(n-1)/2]

Open questions:
Do we use dynamic updating or length,model,probabilities?
+ LMP.
If mode, Gauss or 1+y^2? How to code model parameters?
+ If sum_x_squared is fixed, both lead to uniform distribution on (nD) sphere.
Do we compute last two points from parameters?
+ No, we do not even compute other poit probabilities, just the sphere area.
If updating, how to code first two undetermined points?
+ Average uniform in (zero, max), sigma also uniform on the same interval.
