"""Script fo analyzing 3 result sets for "git bisect" purposes.

Jumpavg library is used for comparing description length of two groupings.
The middle result is grouped with old or new result.
The jump we are looking for is between middle and the smaller group
of the grouping with less bits.
Except when the smallest grouping has all three sets as a separate group.
In that case we look at the bigger difference in averages.
