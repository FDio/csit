"""Script managing reservation and un-reservation of testbeds.

This script provides simple reservation mechanism to avoid
simultaneous use of nodes listed in topology file.
As source of truth, TG node from the topology file is used.

def main():
    """Parse arguments, perform the action, write useful output, propagate RC.

    If the intended action is cancellation, reservation dir is deleted.

    If the intended action is reservation, the list is longer:
    1. List contents of reservation dir.
    2. List contents of test.url file in the dir.
    3. Create reservation dir.
    4. Touch file according to -r option.
    5. Put -u option string to file test.url
    From these 5 steps, 1 and 2 are performed always, their RC ignored.
    RC of step 3 gives the overall result.
    If the result is success, steps 4-5 are executed without any output,
    their RC is ignored.

    The two files in reservation dir are there for reporting
    which test run holds the reservation, so people can manually fix the testbed
    if the rest run has been aborted, or otherwise failed to unregister.

    The two files have different audiences.

    The URL content is useful for people scheduling their test runs
    and wondering why the reservation takes so long.
    For them, a URL (if available) to copy and paste into browser
    to see which test runs are blocking testbeds is the most convenient.

    The "run tag" as a filename is useful for admins accessing the testbed
    via a graphical terminal, which does not allow copying of text,
    as they need less keypresses to identify the test run holding the testbed.
    Also, the listing shows timestamps, which is useful for both audiences.

    This all assumes the target system accepts ssh connections.
    If it does not, the caller probably wants to stop trying
    to reserve this system. Therefore this script can return 3 different codes.
    Return code 0 means the reservation was successful.
    Return code 1 means the system is inaccessible (or similarly unsuitable).
    Return code 2 means the system is accessible, but already reserved.
    The reason unsuitable systems return 1 is because that is also the value
    Python returns on encountering and unexcepted exception.
