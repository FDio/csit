NESTED_VERSION=NO_NESTED

This is a placeholder file to be placed on the main VM if nested VM
testing is not desired, or if the main VM is going to overwrite the
nested VM image by means of startup scripts.

Unless separate steps are taken to provide a valid image within the
VM, NESTED VM TESTCASES WILL FAIL.
