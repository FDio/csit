# Locale sets language and country.
d-i debian-installer/locale string en_US
d-i pkgsel/install-language-support boolean false
# Keyboard selection.
# Disable automatic (interactive) keymap detection.
d-i console-setup/ask_detect boolean false
d-i console-setup/layoutcode string us

### Network configuration
# netcfg will choose an interface that has link if possible. This makes it
# skip displaying a list if there is more than one interface.
d-i netcfg/choose_interface select auto
# If you have a slow dhcp server and the installer times out waiting for
# it, this might be useful.
d-i netcfg/dhcp_timeout string 60
# If you prefer to configure the network manually, uncomment this line and
# the static network configuration below.
#d-i netcfg/disable_dhcp boolean true
# If you want the preconfiguration file to work on systems both with and
# without a dhcp server, uncomment these lines and the static network
# configuration below.
d-i netcfg/dhcp_failed note
#d-i netcfg/dhcp_options select Configure network manually
# Static network configuration.
#d-i netcfg/get_nameservers string 172.30.0.2

#d-i netcfg/get_netmask string 255.255.0.0
#d-i netcfg/get_gateway string 172.30.0.1
#d-i netcfg/confirm_static boolean true
# Any hostname and domain names assigned from dhcp take precedence over
# values set here. However, setting the values still prevents the questions
# from being shown, even if values come from dhcp.
d-i netcfg/get_hostname string unassigned-hostname
d-i netcfg/get_domain string unassigned-domain
# Disable WEP key dialog.
d-i netcfg/wireless_wep string
# Alternatively: by default, the installer uses CC.archive.ubuntu.com where
# CC is the ISO-3166-2 code for the selected country. You can preseed this
# so that it does so without asking.
d-i mirror/http/mirror select us.archive.ubuntu.com

### Mirror settings
d-i live-installer/net-image string http://$http_server/cobbler/links/$distro_name/install/filesystem.squashfs

### Clock and time zone setup
# Controls whether or not the hardware clock is set to UTC.
d-i clock-setup/utc boolean true

# /usr/share/zoneinfo/ for valid values.
d-i time/zone string America/Los_Angeles
# Controls whether to use NTP to set the clock during the install
d-i clock-setup/ntp boolean false

### Partitioning
## If the system has free space you can choose to only partition that space.
# Alternatives: custom, some_device, some_device_crypto, some_device_lvm.
d-i partman-auto/init_automatically_partition select some_device
# Alternatively, you can specify a disk to partition. The device name must
# be given in traditional non-devfs format.
d-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/sda
# In addition, you'll need to specify the method to use.
# The presently available methods are: "regular", "lvm" and "crypto"
d-i partman-auto/method string regular
# If one of the disks that are going to be automatically partitioned
# contains an old LVM configuration, the user will normally receive a
# warning. This can be preseeded away...
d-i partman-lvm/device_remove_lvm boolean true
# The same applies to pre-existing software RAID array:
d-i partman-md/device_remove_md boolean true
# And the same goes for the confirmation to write the lvm partitions.
d-i partman-lvm/confirm boolean true
# You can choose one of the three predefined partitioning recipes:
# - atomic: all files in one partition
# - home:   separate /home partition
# - multi:  separate /home, /usr, /var, and /tmp partitions
d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select atomic
# If you just want to change the default filesystem from ext3 to something
# else, you can do that without providing a full recipe.
d-i partman/default_filesystem string ext4
# This makes partman automatically partition without confirmation, provided
# that you told it what to do using one of the methods above.
d-i partman/confirm_write_new_label boolean true
d-i partman/choose_partition select finish
d-i partman/confirm boolean true
d-i partman/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true

# a root password.
d-i passwd/root-login boolean false
# Root password, either in clear text
#d-i passwd/root-password password pass
#d-i passwd/root-password-again password pass
# or encrypted using an MD5 hash.
#d-i passwd/root-password-crypted password f4f1d7b6738330f521de21da3f563bce
# To create a normal user account.
d-i passwd/user-fullname string testuser
d-i passwd/username string testuser
# Normal user's password, either in clear text

# Individual additional packages to install
d-i pkgsel/include string openssh-server python2.7 python3.6

# Allowed values: none, safe-upgrade, full-upgrade
#d-i pkgsel/upgrade select none
# Policy for applying updates. May be "none" (no automatic updates),
# "unattended-upgrades" (install security updates automatically), or
# "landscape" (manage system with Landscape).
d-i pkgsel/update-policy select none

### Boot loader installation
d-i grub-installer/bootdev string default
# This is fairly safe to set, it makes grub install automatically to the MBR
# if no other operating system is detected on the machine.
d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean false
# This one makes grub-installer install to the MBR if it also finds some other
# OS, which is less safe as it might not be able to boot that other OS.
d-i grub-installer/with_other_os boolean false

### Finishing up the installation
# Avoid that last message about the install being complete.
d-i finish-install/reboot_in_progress note
