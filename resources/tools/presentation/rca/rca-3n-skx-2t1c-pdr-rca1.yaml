    [4] OPEN Progression in one test. Bisect not started yet. [CSIT-1740]

    [5] DONE Progression in performance of tests running VPP (l2xc) inside VM.
    Consequence of a fix making worker placement deterministic, Gerrit 25309.
    [CSIT-1738]

    [6] OPEN Regression in CSIT, one specific test showing too small stdev
    to be considered noise. Tentatively marking also other ipsec anomalies
    with this, although their stdev are high enough to be explained
    as maybe just noise. [CSIT-1742]

    [7] POSTPONED Possible anomaly, but stdev of results is high.
    Currently, the performance differences are considered to probably be just noise.

    [8] OPEN Regressions in some tests with VPP in VM and using l2xcbase as vswitch.
    The results have surprisingly small stdev, more investigation needed.
    [CSIT-1741]

    [9] OPEN Progression in ip6 scale tests. Multiple candidate changes may have
    affect code efficiency, but they have also caused the tests to fail
    for a period of time. [CSIT-1735]

    [10] OPEN Progression in ip6 base tests with dot1q. [CSIT-1746]

    [11] OPEN Progression in memif tests, mainly in avf-eth-l2xcbase-eth-2memif-1dcr.
    Not sure whether all memif tests are affected, nor what the cause is.
    [CSIT-1744]

    [12] OPEN Progression in some l2bdscale tests. [CSIT-1745]

    [16] OPEN Progression in IPsec tests, only for aes128cbc-hmac512sha. [CSIT-1748]

    [17] OPEN Progression in some vhost tests (dpdk in VM). [CSIT-1749]
