    [4] DONE Progression in high performance tests due to Gerrit 26445.
    TRex setting improvement. [CSIT-1740]

    [5] DONE Progression in tests with VPP (l2xc) inside a VM due to
    Gerrit 25309. Make VPP in VM worker placement deterministic.
    [CSIT-1738]

    [6] DONE Apparent regression in CSIT is caused by VPP renaming
    the most performant IPsec plugin, so mismatching CSIT versions
    measure the less performant fallback plugin. [CSIT-1742]

    [7] POSTPONED Possible anomaly, but stdev of results is high.
    Performance differences considered to probably be just noise.

    [8] DONE Regressions in some tests with VPP in VM due to Gerrit
    26744. Switch to clang-9 compiler identified as cause. Tests using
    l2xcbase as vswitch with small stdev used for bisect. [CSIT-1741]

    [9] OPEN Progression in all ip6 scale tests. Changes to vppinfra
    bihash may have improved code efficiency. [CSIT-1735]

    [10] OPEN Progression in ip6 base tests with dot1q. [CSIT-1746]

    [11] OPEN Progression in memif tests, mainly in
    avf-eth-l2xcbase-eth-2memif-1dcr. Two progression candidates found:
    Gerrit 24053 and Gerrit 26744. Performance results are not consistent enough
    to separate the two from other possible causes. [CSIT-1744]

    [12] OPEN Progression in some l2bdscale tests. [CSIT-1745]

    [16] OPEN Apparent progression in IPsec tests, only for aes128cbc-hmac512sha.
    Considering [6], the positive difference is not large enough,
    so there was probably a VPP regression. [CSIT-1748]

    [17] OPEN Progression in some vhost tests (dpdk in VM). [CSIT-1749]
