1: "DONE Regression in ACL tests. The cause is the CSIT part of
    an API change, Gerrit 26112. Instead of failing, the misconfigured VPP
    passes the test, albeit with reduced performance. [CSIT-1739]
"
2: "DONE Regression in tests using random flows.
    The cause is Gerrit 26456, unpinning random seed, needed to make TRex workers
    generate different sequences of packets. [CSIT-1731]
"
3: "DONE Regression in base dot1q-l2xcbase suites. The cause is Gerrit 25363,
    which unified dot1q handling across various tests.
    Previously, this one suite was different (only handling dot1q on one port).
"
4: "OPEN Progression in one test. Bisect not started yet. [CSIT-1740]
"
5: "OPEN Progression in performance of tests running VPP (l2xc) inside VM.
    Due to relatively high stdev of results, bisecting has not found a cause yet.
    [CSIT-1738]
"
6: "OPEN Regression in CSIT, one specific test showing too small stdev
    to be considered noise. Tentatively marking also other ipsec anomalies
    with this, although their stdev are high enough to be explained
    as maybe just noise. [CSIT-1742]
"
7: "POSTPONED Possible anomaly, but stdev of results is high.
    Currently, the performance differences are considered to probably be just noise.
"
8: "OPEN Regressions in some tests with VPP in VM and using l2xcbase as vswitch.
    The results have surprisingly small stdev, more investigation needed.
    [CSIT-1741]
"
9: "OPEN Progression in ip6 scale tests. Multiple candidate changes may have
    affect code efficiency, but they have also caused the tests to fail
    for a period of time. [CSIT-1735]

10:"OPEN Progression in ip6 base tests with dot1q. [CSIT-1746]

11:"OPEN Progression in memif tests, mainly in avf-eth-l2xcbase-eth-2memif-1dcr.
    Not sure whether all memif tests are affected, nor what the cause is.

"
13:"DONE Stateless ACL test have the same performance in 2005.0-4 as in
    2001.0-2, the difference shown here is just a consequence of API change
    having a performance impact when VPP version does not match CSIT version.

"
14:"DONE Statefull ACL test have better performance in 2005.0-4 as in
    2001.0-2, but the difference shown here is inflated due to API change
