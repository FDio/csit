footnote: "
    [1] DONE Regression in ACL tests. The cause is the CSIT part of
    an API change, Gerrit 26112. Instead of failing, the misconfigured VPP
    passes the test, albeit with reduced performance. [CSIT-1739]

    [2] DONE Regression in tests using random flows.
    The cause is Gerrit 26456, unpinning random seed, needed to make TRex workers
    generate different sequences of packets. [CSIT-1731]

    [5] OPEN Progression in performance of tests running VPP (l2xc) inside VM.
    Due to relatively high stdev of results, bisecting has not found a cause yet.
    [CSIT-1738]

    [7] POSTPONED Possible anomaly, but stdev of results is high.
    Currently, the performance differences are considered to probably be just noise.

    [8] OPEN Regressions in some tests with VPP in VM and using l2xcbase as vswitch.
    The results have surprisingly small stdev, more investigation needed.
    [CSIT-1741]

    [9] OPEN Progression in ip6 scale tests. Multiple candidate changes may have
    affect code efficiency, but they have also caused the tests to fail
    for a period of time. [CSIT-1735]

    [11] OPEN Progression in memif tests, mainly in avf-eth-l2xcbase-eth-2memif-1dcr.
    Not sure whether all memif tests are affected, nor what the cause is.
    [CSIT-1744]

    [12] OPEN Progression in some l2bdscale tests. [CSIT-1745]

    [13] DONE Stateless ACL test have the same performance in 2005.0-4 as in
    2001.0-2. The difference shown here is inflated by an API change, see [1].
    [CSIT-1739]

    [14] DONE Statefull ACL test have better performance in 2005.0-4 as in
    2001.0-2. The VPP part of API change, Gerrit 26184, made VPP faster.
    The difference shown here is further inflated by the API change, see [1].
    [CSIT-1739]

    [15] OPEN Progression in nat44 test (not scale ones). [CSIT-1747]

    [17] OPEN Progression in some vhost tests (dpdk in VM). [CSIT-1749]
