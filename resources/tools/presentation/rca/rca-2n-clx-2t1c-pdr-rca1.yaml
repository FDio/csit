    [1] DONE Regression in ACL tests due to Gerrit 26112. With CSIT
    using changed VPP API, instead of failing, misconfigured VPP passes
    the test, albeit with reduced performance. [CSIT-1739]

    [2] DONE Regression in tests using random flow sequencing due to
    Gerrit 26456. Unpinned random seed to make TRex workers generate
    different sequences of packets. [CSIT-1731]

    [3] DONE Regression in base dot1q-l2xcbase suites due to Gerrit
    25363. Unified dot1q handling across various tests. Previously,
    this one suite was different, using dot1q on one port only.

    [5] DONE Progression in tests with VPP (l2xc) inside a VM due to
    Gerrit 25309. Make VPP in VM worker placement deterministic.
    [CSIT-1738]

    [7] POSTPONED Possible anomaly, but stdev of results is high.
    Performance differences considered to probably be just noise.

    [9] OPEN Progression in all ip6 scale tests. Changes to vppinfra
    bihash may have improved code efficiency. [CSIT-1735]

    [10] OPEN Progression in ip6 base tests with dot1q. [CSIT-1746]

    [11] OPEN Progression in memif tests, mainly in
    avf-eth-l2xcbase-eth-2memif-1dcr. [CSIT-1744]

    [12] OPEN Progression in some l2bdscale tests. [CSIT-1745]

    [13] DONE Stateless ACL test have the same performance in 2005.0-4
    as in 2001.0-2. The difference shown here is inflated by an API
    change, see [1]. [CSIT-1739]

    [14] DONE Stateful ACL test have better performance in 2005.0-4 as
    in 2001.0-2. The VPP part of API change, Gerrit 26184, made VPP
    faster. The difference shown here is further inflated by the API
    change, see [1]. [CSIT-1739]

    [15] OPEN Progression in nat44 test (not scale ones). [CSIT-1747]

    [17] OPEN Progression in some vhost tests (dpdk in VM). [CSIT-1749]
