Jumpavg library
===============

Origins
-------

This library was developed as anomaly detection logic
for PAL_ (Presentation and Analysis Layer)
of CSIT_ (Continuous System and Integration Testing)
project of fd.io_ (Fast Data), one of LFN_
(Linux Foundation Networking) projects.

In order to make this code available in PyPI_ (Python Package Index),
and to avoid rigid release cadence of CSIT,
the library has been moved into this standalone project.

Usage
-----

TODO.
