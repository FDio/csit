# This file should be executed from tox, as the assumed working directory
# is different from where this file is located.
# This file does not have executable flag nor shebang,
# to dissuade non-tox callers.

# This script runs a two grep commands as "if" conditions,
# using log files to store the data (generated by git commands) to grep,
# failing when model implementation edits do not come with model version edit.
# The contents of the log files may be useful when fail cause is not obvious.

# "set -eu" handles failures from the following two lines.
