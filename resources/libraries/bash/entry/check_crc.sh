# This entry script does not change CSIT branch,
# use "with_oper_for_vpp.sh" wrapper for that.
#
# Assumptions:
# + There is a directory holding VPP repo with patch under test checked out.
# + It contains csit subdirectory with CSIT code to use (this script is there).
# + Everything needed to generate .api.json files is already installed locally.
# Consequences:
# + At the end, VPP repo has parent commit checked out and built.
# + Directories build_root, build and csit are reset during the run.
# + The following directory (relative to VPP repo) is (re)created:
# ++ build-root/install-vpp-native/vpp/share/vpp/api

# "set -eu" handles failures from the following two lines.
