# Assumptions:
# + There is a directory holding CSIT code to use (this script is there).
# + At least one of the following is true:
# ++ JOB_NAME environment variable is set,
# ++ or this entry script has access to arguments.
# Consequences (and specific assumptions) are multiple,
# examine tree of functions for current description.

# FIXME: Define API contract (as opposed to just help) for bootstrap.
