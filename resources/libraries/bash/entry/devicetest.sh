# Run selection of "device" tests on a VPP build, fail if a test fails.
#
# This is a common bootstrap for csit-vpp and vpp-csit jobs,
# the difference is whether VPP build is downloaded or built from source.
# The two jobs have different directory structure in workspace,
# but the functions hide this fact, so most of the logic is identical.
# That is important, otherwise a CSIT change verified on csit-vpp
# could break vpp-csit, which votes on VPP changes.
#
# This entry script does not change CSIT branch,
# use "with_oper_for_vpp.sh" wrapper for that.
#
# Common assumptions:
# + At least one of the following is true:
# ++ JOB_NAME environment variable is set,
# ++ or this entry script has access to arguments, first one is job name.

# "set -eu" handles failures from the following two lines.
