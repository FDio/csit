# This entry script does not change which CSIT branch is used,
# use "with_oper_for_vpp.sh" wrapper for that.
#
# This script is to be used for locating performance regressions
# (or breakages, or progressions, or fixes).
# It uses "git bisect" commands on the VPP repository,
# between the triggered VPP patch and a commit specified in the first argument
# of the gerrit comment text.
# The other arguments are used as tag expressions for selecting tests as usual.
# Currently only MRR test type is supported.
#
# Logs are present in the archive directory, bu usually the main output
# is the offending commit as identified by "git bisect", visible in console.
#
# While selecting just one testcase is the intended use,
# this script should be able to deal with multiple testcases as well,
# grouping all the values together. This usually inflates
# the standard deviation, but it is not clear how that affects the bisection.
#
# For the bisection decision, jumpavg library is used,
# deciding whether shorter description is achieved by forcefully grouping
# the middle results with the old, or with the new ones.
#
# If any test failure happens, one retry is attempted.
# If all tries fail, an artificial result is used to distinguish
# from normal results. Currently, the value 2.0, with the same multiplicity
# is used for fail results.
#
# Note that if there was a VPP API change that affects tests in the interval,
# there usually is not good way for single CSIT commit to work there.
# You can try manually reverting the CSIT changes to make tests pass,
# possibly needing to search over multiple subintervals.
#
# If a regression happens during a subinterval where the test fails
# due to bug in VPP, you may try to create a new commit chain
# with the fix cherry-picked to the start of the interval.
# Do not do that on Gerrit, as that would open multiple fake changes.
#
# Assumptions:
# + There is a directory holding VPP repo with patch under test checked out.
# + It contains csit subdirectory with CSIT code to use (this script is there).
# + Everything needed to build VPP is already installed locally.
# Consequences:
# + Working directory is switched to the VPP repo root.
# + At the end, VPP repo has checked out and built some commit,
#   used last in "git bisect".
# + Directories build_root, build and csit are reset during the run.
# + The following directories (relative to VPP repo) are (re)created:
# ++ csit_current, csit_parent, build_current, build_parent,
# ++ archive, csit/archive, csit/download_dir.
# Arguments:
# - ${1} - If present, override JOB_NAME to simplify manual usage.

# "set -eu" handles failures from the following two lines.
