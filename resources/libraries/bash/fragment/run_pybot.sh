# Currently, VPP-1361 causes occasional test failures.
# If real result is more important than time, we can retry few times.
# TODO: We should be retrying on test case level instead.

# Arguments:
# - $1 - Number of pybot invocations to attempt to avoid failures. Default: 1.
# Variables read:
# - CSIT_DIR - Path to directory with root of local CSIT git repository.
# - ARCHIVE_DIR - Path to store robot result files in.
# - PYBOT_ARGS, EXPANDED_TAGS - See compose_pybot_arguments.sh
# Variables set:
# - PYBOT_EXIT_STATUS - Exit status of most recent pybot invocation.
