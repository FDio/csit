| | ... | for example in stateful NAT scale tests.
| | ... | Return type: integer.

| | ... | is different from merely counting the packets received from DUT.
| | ... | Return type: string.
| |
| | ... | *Example:*

| Set Jumbo
| | [Documentation]
| | ... | For jumbo frames detection, the maximal packet size is relevant,
| | ... | encapsulation overhead (if any) has effect.

| | ... | This keyword computes jumbo boolean (some suites need that for
| | ... | configuration decisions).
| | ... | To streamline suite autogeneration, both input and output values
| | ... | are communicated as test (or broader scope) variables,

| | Set Test Variable | \${jumbo}

| Set Max Rate And Jumbo
| | [Documentation]
| | ... | Input framesize can be either integer in case of a single packet
| | ... | in stream, or IMIX string defining mix of packets.
| | ... | For jumbo frames detection, the maximal packet size is relevant.
| | ... | For maximal transmit rate, the average packet size is relevant.
| | ... | In both cases, encapsulation overhead (if any) has effect.
| | ... | The maximal rate is computed from NIC name.
| | ... | The implementation works by mapping from exact
| | ... | whitelisted NIC names.
| | ... | The mapping is hardcoded in nic_limits.yaml
| | ... | TODO: Make the mapping from NIC names case insensistive.
| |
| | ... | This keyword computes maximal unidirectional transmit rate
| | ... | and jumbo boolean (some suites need that for configuration decisions).
| | ... | To streamline suite autogeneration, both input and output values
| | ... | are communicated as test (or broader scope) variables,
| | ... | instead of explicit arguments and return values.
| |
| | ... | If this keyword detects the test is interested in (unidirectional)
| | ... | transactons per second maximal rate (tps), that is returned (not pps).
| |
| | ... | *Test (or broader scope) variables read:*

| Set Numeric Frame Sizes
| | [Documentation]
| | ... | Framesize can be either integer in case of a single packet
| | ... | in stream, or set of packets in case of IMIX type or simmilar.
| | ... | For jumbo decisions, we need a numeric size of the biggest packet.
| | ... | For max rate decisions, we need a numeric average packet size.
| | ... | This keyword computes both and sets them as test variables.
| |
| | ... | Each suite sets a value named \${overhead},
| | ... | which describes by how many bytes the frames on DUT-DUT link
| | ... | are larger (due to encapsulation) than those
| | ... | on the primary TG-DUT link. But for some suites that value
| | ... | can be negaive (if TG-DUT is encapsulated more heavily).
| | ... | For calculations in this keyword, we need largest sizes
| | ... | across links, so zero is used if \${overhead} is negative.
| |
| | ... | *Test variables read:*
| | ... | - frame_size - Framesize. Type: integer or string
| | ... | - overhead - Overhead in bytes; default value: ${0}. Type: integer
