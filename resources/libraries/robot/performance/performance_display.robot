| | ... | Compute (bidir) bandwidth from given (unidir) transaction rate.
| | ...
| | ... | This keyword reads \${ppta} and \${avg_aggregated_frame_size} set
| | ... | elsewhere. The implementation should work for both pps and cps rates.
| | ... |
| | ... | *Arguments:*
| | ... | - tps - Transaction rate (unidirectional) [tps]. Type: float
| | ...
| | ... | *Returns:*
| | ... | - Computed bandwidth in Gbps.
| | ... | - Computed aggregated packet rate in pps.
| |
| | ... | *Example:*
| |
| | ... | |\ \${bandwidth} \| \${pps} = \| Compute Bandwidth \| \${12345.67} \|
| |
| | [Arguments] | ${tps}
| |
| | ${ppta} = | Get Packets Per Transaction Aggregated
| | ${pps} = | Evaluate | ${tps} * ${ppta}

| | ... | If a lower bound is not valid, fail.
| | ... |
| | ... | Througput is calculated as:
| | ... | Sum of measured rate over streams
| | ... | Bandwidth is calculated as:
| | ... | (Throughput * (L2 Frame Size + IPG) * 8)
