"""Module holding functions for avoiding rounding underflows.

Some applications wish to manipulate non-negative numbers
which are many orders of magnitude apart.
In those circumstances, it is useful to store
the logarithm of the intended number.

As math.log(0.0) raises an exception (instead returning -inf or nan),
and 0.0 might be a result of computation caused only by rounding error,
functions of this module use None as -inf.

TODO: Figure out a more performant way of handling -inf.

The functions handle the common task of adding or subtracting
two numbers where both operands and the result is given in logarithm form.
There are conditionals to make sure overflow does not happen (if possible)
during the computation."""
