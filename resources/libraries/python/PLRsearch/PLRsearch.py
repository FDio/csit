        Considering measurer and packet_loss_ratio_target (see __init__),
        find such an offered load (called critical load) that is expected
        to hit the target loss ratio in the limit of very long trial duration.
        As the system is probabilistic (and test duration is finite),
        the critical ratio is only estimated.
        Return the average and standard deviation of the estimate.

        In principle, this algorithm performs trial measurements,
        each with varied offered load (which is constant during the trial).
        During each measurement, Bayesian inference is performed
        on all the measurement results so far.
        When timeout is up, the last estimate is returned,
        else another trial is performed.

        It is assumed that the system under test, even though not deterministic,
        still follows the rule of large numbers. In another words,
        any growing set of measurements at a particular offered load
        will converge towards unique (for the given load) packet loss ratio.
        This means there is a deterministic (but unknown) function
        mapping the offered load to average loss ratio.
        This function is called loss ratio function.
        This also assumes the average loss ratio
        does not depend on trial duration.

        The actual probability distribution of loss counts, achieving
        the average ratio on trials of various duration
        can be complicated (and can depend on offered load), but simply assuming
        Poisson distribution will make the algorithm converge.
        Binomial distribution would be more precise,
        but Poisson is more practical, as it effectively gives
        less information content to high ratio results.

        Even when applying other assumptions on the loss ratio function
        (increasing function, limit zero ratio when load goes to zero,
        global upper limit on rate of packets processed), there are still
        too many different shapes of possible loss functions,
        which makes full Bayesian reasoning intractable.

        This implementation radically simplifies things by examining
        only two shapes, each with finitely many (in this case just two)
        parameters. In other words, two fitting functions
        (each with two parameters and one argument).
        When restricting model space to one of the two fitting functions,
        the Bayesian inference becomes tractable (even though it needs
        numerical integration from Integrator class).

        The first measurement is done at the middle between
        min_rate and max_rate, to help with convergence
        if max_rate measurements give loss below target.
        TODO: Fix overflow error and use min_rate instead of the middle.

        The second measurement is done at max_rate, next few measurements
        have offered load of previous load minus excess loss rate.
        This simple rule is found to be good when offered loads
        so far are way above the critical rate. After few measurements,
        inference from fitting functions converges faster that this initial
        "optimistic" procedure.

        Offered loads close to (limiting) critical rate are the most useful,
        as linear approximation of the fitting function
        becomes good enough there (thus reducing the impact
        of the overall shape of fitting function).
        After several trials, usually one of the fitting functions
        has better predictions than the other one, but the algorithm
        does not track that. Simply, it uses the estimate average,
        alternating between the functions.
        Multiple workarounds are applied to try and avoid measurements
        both in zero loss region and in big loss region,
        as their results tend to make the critical load estimate worse.

        The returned average and stdev is a combination of the two fitting
        estimates.

        High level steps: Prepare and launch computation worker processes,
        perform the measurement, stop computation and combine results.

        Integrator needs a specific function to process (-1, 1) parameters.
        As our fitting functions use dimensional parameters,
        so a transformation is performed, resulting in a specific prior
        distribution over the dimensional parameters.
        Maximal rate (line rate) is needed for that transformation.

        Two fitting functions are used, computation is started
        on temporary worker process per fitting function. After the measurement,
        average and stdev of the critical rate (not log) of each worker
        are combined and returned. Raw averages are also returned,
        offered load for next iteration is chosen based on them.
        The idea is that one fitting function might be fitting much better,
        measurements at its avg are best for relevant results (for both),
        but we do not know which fitting function it is.
