class MultipleLossRatioSearch(AbstractSearchAlgorithm):
    """Optimized binary search algorithm for finding NDR and PDR bounds.

    Traditional binary search algorithm needs initial interval
    (lower and upper bound), and returns final interval after bisecting
    (until some exit condition is met).
    The exit condition is usually related to the interval width,
    (upper bound value minus lower bound value).

    The optimized algorithm contains several improvements
    aimed to reduce overall search time.

    One improvement is searching for two intervals at once.
    The intervals are for NDR (No Drop Rate) and PDR (Partial Drop Rate).

    Next improvement is that the initial interval does not need to be valid.
    Imagine initial interval (10, 11) where 11 is smaller
    than the searched value.
    The algorithm will try (11, 13) interval next, and if 13 is still smaller,
    (13, 17) and so on, doubling width until the upper bound is valid.
    The part when interval expands is called external search,
    the part when interval is bisected is called internal search.

    Next improvement is that trial measurements at small trial duration
    can be used to find a reasonable interval for full trial duration search.
    This results in more trials performed, but smaller overall duration
    in general.

    Next improvement is bisecting in logarithmic quantities,
    so that exit criteria can be independent of measurement units.

    Next improvement is basing the initial interval on receive rates.

    Final improvement is exiting early if the minimal value
    is not a valid lower bound.

    The complete search consist of several phases,
    each phase performing several trial measurements.
    Initial phase creates initial interval based on receive rates
    at maximum rate and at maximum receive rate (MRR).
    Final phase and preceding intermediate phases are performing
    external and internal search steps,
    each resulting interval is the starting point for the next phase.
    The resulting interval of final phase is the result of the whole algorithm.

    Each non-initial phase uses its own trial duration and width goal.
    Any non-initial phase stops searching (for NDR or PDR independently)
    when minimum is not a valid lower bound (at current duration),
    or all of the following is true:
    Both bounds are valid, bound bounds are measured at the current phase
    trial duration, interval width is less than the width goal
    for current phase.
