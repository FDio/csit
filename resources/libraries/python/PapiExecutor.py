    A more useful version would be to keep obj mostly as a namedtuple,

    from tuple, including its read-only __getitem__ attribute,
    so we cannot monkey-patch it.

    """Methods for executing VPP Python API commands on forwarded socket.

    The current implementation connects for the duration of resource manager.
    Delay for accepting connection is 10s, and disconnect is explicit.
    TODO: Decrease 10s to value that is long enough for creating connection
    and short enough to not affect performance.

    The current implementation downloads and parses .api.json files only once
    and stores a VPPApiClient instance (disconnected) as a class variable.
    Accessing multiple nodes with different APIs is therefore not supported.

    The current implementation seems to run into read error occasionally.
    Not sure if the error is in Python code on Robot side, ssh forwarding,
    or socket handling at VPP side. Anyway, reconnect after some sleep
    seems to help, hoping repeated command execution does not lead to surprises.
    The reconnection is logged at WARN level, so it is prominently shown
    in log.html, so we can see how frequently it happens.

    TODO: Support sockets in NFs somehow.
    TODO: Support handling of retval!=0 without try/except in caller.

    Note: Use only with "with" statement, e.g.:

        with PapiSocketExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
            reply = papi_exec.add('show_version').get_reply(err_msg)

    This class processes two classes of VPP PAPI methods:
    1. Simple request / reply: method='request'.
    2. Dump functions: method='dump'.

    Note that access to VPP stats over socket is not supported yet.

    The recommended ways of use are (examples):

    1. Simple request / reply

    a. One request with no arguments:

        with PapiSocketExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
            reply = papi_exec.add('show_version').get_reply(err_msg)

    b. Three requests with arguments, the second and the third ones are the same
       but with different arguments.

        with PapiSocketExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
            replies = papi_exec.add(cmd1, **args1).add(cmd2, **args2).\
                add(cmd2, **args3).get_replies(err_msg)

    2. Dump functions

        cmd = 'sw_interface_rx_placement_dump'
        with PapiSocketExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
            details = papi_exec.add(cmd, sw_if_index=ifc['vpp_sw_index']).\

    TODO: Remove .add step, make get_stats accept paths directly.

    This class processes only one type of VPP PAPI methods: vpp-stats.

    The recommended ways of use are (examples):

    path = ['^/if', '/err/ip4-input', '/sys/node/ip4-input']
    with PapiExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
        stats = papi_exec.add(api_name='vpp-stats', path=path).get_stats()

    print('RX interface core 0, sw_if_index 0:\n{0}'.\
        format(stats[0]['/if/rx'][0][0]))

    or

    path_1 = ['^/if', ]
    path_2 = ['^/if', '/err/ip4-input', '/sys/node/ip4-input']
    with PapiExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
        stats = papi_exec.add('vpp-stats', path=path_1).\

    print('RX interface core 0, sw_if_index 0:\n{0}'.\
        format(stats[1]['/if/rx'][0][0]))

    Note: In this case, when PapiExecutor method 'add' is used:
    - its parameter 'csit_papi_command' is used only to keep information
      that vpp-stats are requested. It is not further processed but it is
      included in the PAPI history this way:
      vpp-stats(path=['^/if', '/err/ip4-input', '/sys/node/ip4-input'])
      Always use csit_papi_command="vpp-stats" if the VPP PAPI method
      is "stats".
    - the second parameter must be 'path' as it is used by PapiExecutor
      method 'add'.
