class PapiSocketExecutor:
    """Methods for executing VPP Python API commands on forwarded socket.

    The current implementation downloads and parses .api.json files only once
    and caches client instances for reuse.
    Cleanup metadata is added as additional attributes
    directly to the client instances.

    The current implementation caches the connected client instances.
    As a downside, clients need to be explicitly told to disconnect
    before VPP restart.

    The current implementation seems to run into read error occasionally.
    Not sure if the error is in Python code on Robot side, ssh forwarding,
    or socket handling at VPP side. Anyway, reconnect after some sleep
    seems to help, hoping repeated command execution does not lead to surprises.
    The reconnection is logged at WARN level, so it is prominently shown
    in log.html, so we can see how frequently it happens.
    There are similar retries cleanups in other places
    (so unresponsive VPPs do not break test much more than needed),
    but it is hard to verify all that works correctly.
    Especially, if Robot crashes, files and ssh processes may leak.

    TODO: Decrease current timeout value when creating connections
    so broken VPP does not prolong job duration too much
    while good VPP (almost) never fails to connect.

    TODO: Support handling of retval!=0 without try/except in caller.

    This class processes two classes of VPP PAPI methods:
    1. Simple request / reply: method='request'.
    2. Dump functions: method='dump'.

    Note that access to VPP stats over socket is not supported yet.

    The recommended ways of use are (examples):

    1. Simple request / reply. Example with no arguments:

        cmd = "show_version"
        with PapiSocketExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
            reply = papi_exec.add(cmd).get_reply(err_msg)

    2. Dump functions:

        cmd = "sw_interface_rx_placement_dump"
        with PapiSocketExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
            papi_exec.add(cmd, sw_if_index=ifc["vpp_sw_index"])
            details = papi_exec.get_details(err_msg)

    3. Multiple requests with one reply each.
       In this example, there are three requests with arguments,
       the second and the third ones are the same but with different arguments.
       This example also showcases method chaining.

        with PapiSocketExecutor(node, is_async=True) as papi_exec:
            replies = papi_exec.add(cmd1, **args1).add(cmd2, **args2).\
                add(cmd2, **args3).get_replies(err_msg)

    The "is_async=True" part in the last example enables "async handling mode",
    which imposes limitations but gains speed and saves memory.
    This is different than async mode of VPP PAPI, as the default handling mode
    also uses async PAPI connections.

    The implementation contains more hidden details, such as
    support for old VPP PAPI async mode behavior, API CRC checking
    conditional usage of control ping, and possible susceptibility to VPP-2033.
    See docstring of methods for more detailed info.
