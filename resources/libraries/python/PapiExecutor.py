class PapiSocketExecutor:
    """Methods for executing VPP Python API commands on forwarded socket.

    Previously, we used an implementation with single client instance
    and connection being handled by a resource manager.
    On "with" statement, the instance connected, and disconnected
    on exit from the "with" block.
    This was limiting (no nested with blocks) and mainly it was slow
    (0.7 seconds per disconnect cycle on Skylake, more than 3 second on Taishan).

    The currently use implementation caches the connected client instances,
    providing speedup and making "with" blocks unnecessary.
    But with many call sites, "with" blocks are still the main usage pattern.
    Documentation still lists that as the intended pattern.

    As a downside, clients should be explicitly told to disconnect
    before VPP restart.
    There is some amount of retries and disconnects on teardown,
    but it is hard to verify all that works correctly.
    Especially, if Robot crashes, files and ssh processes may leak.

    Delay for accepting socket connection is 10s.
    TODO: Decrease 10s to value that is long enough for creating connection
    and short enough to not affect performance.

    The current implementation downloads and parses .api.json files only once
    and caches client instances for reuse.
    Cleanup metadata is added as additional attributes
    directly to client instances.

    The current implementation seems to run into read error occasionally.
    Not sure if the error is in Python code on Robot side, ssh forwarding,
    or socket handling at VPP side. Anyway, reconnect after some sleep
    seems to help, hoping repeated command execution does not lead to surprises.
    The reconnection is logged at WARN level, so it is prominently shown
    in log.html, so we can see how frequently it happens.

    TODO: Support handling of retval!=0 without try/except in caller.

    Note: Use only with "with" statement, e.g.:

        cmd = 'show_version'
        with PapiSocketExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
            reply = papi_exec.add(cmd).get_reply(err_msg)

    This class processes two classes of VPP PAPI methods:
    1. Simple request / reply: method='request'.
    2. Dump functions: method='dump'.

    Note that access to VPP stats over socket is not supported yet.

    The recommended ways of use are (examples):

    1. Simple request / reply

    a. One request with no arguments:

        cmd = 'show_version'
        with PapiSocketExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
            reply = papi_exec.add(cmd).get_reply(err_msg)

    b. Three requests with arguments, the second and the third ones are the same
       but with different arguments.

        with PapiSocketExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
            replies = papi_exec.add(cmd1, **args1).add(cmd2, **args2).\
                add(cmd2, **args3).get_replies(err_msg)

    2. Dump functions

        cmd = 'sw_interface_rx_placement_dump'
        with PapiSocketExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
            details = papi_exec.add(cmd, sw_if_index=ifc['vpp_sw_index']).\
