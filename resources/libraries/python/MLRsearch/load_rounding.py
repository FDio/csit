class LoadRounding:
    """State for stateful utilities that round intended load values.

    For MLRsearch algorithm logic to be correct, it is important
    interval width expansion and narrowing are exactly reversible,
    which is not true in general for floating point number arithmetics.

    This class offers conversion to and from an integer quantity.
    Operations in the integer realm are guaranteed to be reversible,
    so the only risk is when converting betwwn float and integer realm.

    What relative width corresponds to the unit integer
    is dynamically computed from width goals,
    striking a balance between memory requirements and precision.

    There are two quality goals. One restricts how far
    can an integer be from the exact float value.
    The other restrict how close it can be. That is to make sure
    even with unpredictable rounding errors during the conversion,
    the converted integer value is never bigger than the intended float value,
    to ensure the resulting intervals from MLRsearch will always
    meet the relative width goal.

    Even more convenience is offered when (integer) goals are offered
    as DiscreteWidth instances. To avoid circular dependencies (type hints),
    this class does not offer that convenience; see LoadRounding.
