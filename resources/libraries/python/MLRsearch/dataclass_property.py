"""Module defining some utility functions to serve as a syntactic sugar.

The main issue that needs support is dataclasses with properties
(including setters) and with default values, including mutable ones
(meaning default_factory would ordinarilty be used).

First, this explains how property ends up passes as default constructor value:
https://florimond.dev/en/posts/2018/10/reconciling-dataclasses-and-properties-in-python/
TL;DR: By the time __init__ is generated, original class variable (type hint)
is replaced by property (method definition).

Second, there are ways to deal with that:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/61480946
TL;DR: It relies on the underscored field being replaced by the value.

But that does not work for field which use default_factory
(the underscored class field is deleted instead).

So another way is needed to store a mutable default value,
so setter can use it when called with property instead of value.

This implementation relies on a fact that decorators are executed
when the class field do exist, and decorated function
does know its name, so the decorator can get the value stored in
class field, and store it as an additional attribute for the function.
Then for setter, the property contains the getter (as an unbound function),
so it can access the additional attribute to get the value.

This approach circumvents the precautions dataclasses take to prevent mishaps
when a single mutable object is shared between multiple instances.
So it is up to setters to create an appropriate copy of the default object.

    This implementation transparently finds and inserts the default value
