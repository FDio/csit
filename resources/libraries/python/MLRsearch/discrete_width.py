    The Base part means this class does not support arithmetic operations
    between width (and load) values. This is done to avoid circular type hints.

    BaseLoadRounding instance is needed to enable conversion between two forms.
    In practice, LoadRounding instances will be used by callers,
    but LoadRounding definition depends on DiscreteWidth,
    hence two rounding classes to avoid circular type hints.

    Conversion and arithmetic methods are added for convenience.
    Division and non-integer multiplication are intentionally not supported,
    as MLRsearch should not seek unround widths when round ones are available.
