    LoadRounding instance is needed to enable conversion between two forms.
    In practice, LoadRounding instances will be used by callers,
    but LoadRounding definition depends on DiscreteWidth,
    hence two rounding classes to avoid circular type hints.

    Conversion and arithmetic methods are added for convenience.
    Division and non-integer multiplication are intentionally _not_ supported,
