@dataclass
class MultipleLossRatioSearch:
    """Optimized binary search algorithm for finding conditional througputs.

    Traditional binary search algorithm needs initial interval
    (lower and upper bound), and returns final narrow bounds
    (related to its search goal) after bisecting
    (until some exit condition is met).
    The exit condition is usually related to the interval width,
    (upper bound tps value minus lower bound value).

    The optimized algorithm in this class contains several improvements
    aimed to reduce overall search time.

    One improvement is searching for bounds for multiple search goals at once.
    Specifically, the trial measurement results influence bounds for all goals,
    even though the selection of trial imputs for next measurement
    focused only on one goal (but the focus can switch between goal any time).

    Next improvement is that the "current" interval does not need to be valid
    (e.g. one of the bounds is missing).
    In that case, this algorithm will move and expand the interval,
    in a process called external search. Only when both bounds are found,
    the interval bisection (called internal search) starts making it narrow.

    Next improvement is that results of trial measurements
    with small trial duration can be used to find a reasonable starting interval
    for full trial duration search.
    This results in more trials performed, but smaller overall duration
    in general.
    Internally, such shorter trials come from "preceding targets",
    handles in a same way as a search goal "final target".

    Next improvement is bisecting in logarithmic quantities,
    so that target relative width is independent of measurement units.

    Next improvement is basing the initial interval on forwarding rates
    of few initial measurements, starting at max load and using forwarding rates
    seen so far.

    Final improvement is exiting early if the minimal load
    is not a valid lower bound (at final duration)
    and also exiting if the overall search duration is too long.

    FIXME below.
    The complete search consist of several phases,
    each phase performing several trial measurements.
    Initial phase creates initial interval based on forwarding rates
    at maximum rate and at maximum forwarding rate (MRR).
    Final phase and preceding intermediate phases are performing
    external and internal search steps,
    each resulting interval is the starting point for the next phase.
    The resulting intervals of final phase is the result of the whole algorithm.
    Smaller loss ratio goals are searched first (until relative width goal
    at final trial duration) before first intermediat phase
    starts for next loss ratio goal.

    Each non-initial phase uses its own trial duration.
    Any non-initial phase stops searching (for smallest ratio goal)
    when min load is not a valid lower bound (at current duration),
    or all of the following is true (for any ratio goal):
    Both bounds are valid, bounds are measured at the current phase
    trial duration (or longer), interval width is less than the width goal
    for the current phase.

    Note that bounds are not really hardwired to loss ratio goals.
    For each goal, the database of results is queried
    to find tightest bounds (if any).

    TODO: Review and update all terminology once it is frozen.
