"""Classes for IP addresses and networks, with multiple serialization options.

Some usage (PAPI) wants to serialize as dicts,
other (VAT2, CLI) prefer serialization to human readable strings.

Classes subclassed from dict and with __str__ method cover both usages.
Several methods are added to make the instance usable instead of results of
ip_address and ip_network.

Also, several factory methods are added to simplify call sites.
False address arguments are converted to 0.0.0.0 (all zero bytes for PAPI).

TODO: Add (optional) checking of dict-like constructor kwargs.
TODO: Investigate speed in scale tests, add special quick functions if needed.
