    This class contains methods that mutate the internal state,

    The Sequence-like access is related to the list of runs,
    for example group[0] returns the first run in the list.
    Writable list-like methods are not implemented.

    As the group bit count depends on previous average
    and overall maximal value, those values are assumed
    to be known beforehand (and immutable).

    As the caller is allowed to divide runs into groups in any way,
    a method to add a signe run in an efficient manner is provided.
