class PapiSocketExecutor:
    """Methods for executing VPP Python API commands on forwarded socket.

    The current implementation connects for the duration of resource manager.
    Delay for accepting connection is 14s, and disconnect is explicit.
    TODO: Decrease 14s to value that is long enough for creating connection
    and short enough to not cause failures performance.

    The current implementation downloads and parses .api.json files only once
    and stores a VPPApiClient instance (disconnected) as a class variable.
    Accessing multiple nodes with different APIs is therefore not supported.

    The current implementation seems to run into read error occasionally.
    Not sure if the error is in Python code on Robot side, ssh forwarding,
    or socket handling at VPP side. Anyway, reconnect after some sleep
    seems to help, hoping repeated command execution does not lead to surprises.
    The reconnection is logged at WARN level, so it is prominently shown
    in log.html, so we can see how frequently it happens.

    TODO: Support handling of retval!=0 without try/except in caller.

    Note: Use only with "with" statement, e.g.:

        cmd = 'show_version'
        with PapiSocketExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
            reply = papi_exec.add(cmd).get_reply(err_msg)

    This class processes two classes of VPP PAPI methods:
    1. Simple request / reply: method='request'.
    2. Dump functions: method='dump'.

    Note that access to VPP stats over socket is not supported yet.

    The recommended ways of use are (examples):

    1. Simple request / reply

    a. One request with no arguments:

        cmd = 'show_version'
        with PapiSocketExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
            reply = papi_exec.add(cmd).get_reply(err_msg)

    b. Three requests with arguments, the second and the third ones are the same
       but with different arguments.

        with PapiSocketExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
            replies = papi_exec.add(cmd1, **args1).add(cmd2, **args2).\
                add(cmd2, **args3).get_replies(err_msg)

    2. Dump functions

        cmd = 'sw_interface_rx_placement_dump'
        with PapiSocketExecutor(node) as papi_exec:
            details = papi_exec.add(cmd, sw_if_index=ifc['vpp_sw_index']).\
