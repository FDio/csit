    """Return an enum instance matching the string name.

    In Robot, it is not convenient to construct Enum instances,
    most values defined in Robot are strings.

    This helper function can be used in Python L1 keywords
    to convert string into the corresponding Enum instance.
    Aliases are also recognized.

    As an added benefit, support various Robot-like niceties,
    like lower case, or dash or space instead of underscore.

    As a common shortcut, value is returned it it already is an instance.

    Another convenience: None or empty string is processed as "NONE".

    If the class is a subclass of IntEnum, int values
    and (string) values convertable to int are also accepted as input.

    :param enum_class: Class object instance of which should be returned.
    :param value: String or any other recognized form of an enum instance.
    :type enum_class: Type[Enum]
    :type value: Union[enum_class, str, int, None]
    :returns: The matching instance, if found.
    :rtype: enum_class
    :raises: ValueError if no matching instance is found.
