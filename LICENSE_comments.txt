Disclaimer: Not written by a lawyer.

CSIT is a software project without a binary distribution.
The whole git repository (including history) is both
the Source form and the Object form of CSIT.

While the Apache License, Version 2.0
  https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
still applies to CSIT as a whole,
CSIT uses a specific way to fulfill its license conditions.

> 4.a You must give any other recipients of the Work or
> Derivative Works a copy of this License;

Single LICENSE file at the top to git repository is enough.
Per-file license notices are allowed, but unnecessary.

> 4.b You must cause any modified files to carry
> prominent notices stating that You changed the files;

While copright notices are allowed, they are only informative.
As every contribution contains a sign-off and a date,
the true record of file modifications is the git history.

> 4.c You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
> that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
> attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
> excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
> the Derivative Works;

Removal of duplicate notices is allowed, as long as at least one notice
(of each type) still covers the same parts of CSIT.

> 4.d If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution
(...)

CSIT does contain a NOTICE file, but that file does not contain any
specific attributions. Instead it contains parts of FD.io charter,
specifying two licenses that apply.
One for "inbound code" and "outbound code", other for "documentation".

Currently, it is not clear which parts (files) of CSIT are covered
by which license (or both, or neither).
