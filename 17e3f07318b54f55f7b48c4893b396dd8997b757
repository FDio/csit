      "message": "IMHO, this should not be a todo as having to go look through all of the commits in the log to figure out which one(s) are bad is a pain.\n\nInstead of trying to run this in a single piped line, I would recommend using a for loop on the output of the \u0027git diff\u0027, then detecting the failure, and outputting both filename and copyright line to the log.\n\nfor file in $(git diff --name-only HEAD~) ; do\n    bad_copyright \u003d piped_command using \"head -n 3 $file\u0027|...\"\n    if [ -n \"$bad_copyright\" ] ; then\n        echo -e \"Invalid copyright found in $file:\\n$bad_copyright\\n\\n\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nWhile arguably less efficient than the code in this patch, it produces the desired results.",
