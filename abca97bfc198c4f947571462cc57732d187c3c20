      "message": "The methodology is not completely clear, see previous comment.\nLooking at graphs at: https://docs.fd.io/csit/master/report/vpp_performance_tests/nf_service_density/vnf_service_chains_reconf.html#n-skx-xxv710\n\nFollowing information is unclear:\n- Implied Time Lost [s]: first graph shows 4sec or more, this is a significant outage for a single re-configuration transaction, unless the unit is [msec] or [usec] that is :). If there are more than 1 re-config transaction it should be specified. The actual sequence of commands within a re-config transaction should be specified too. \n- Test Case [Index]: \"avg pkt loss: 12.1\", if this is averaged packet count one can indeed derive the NDR rate from reported time, but with 4sec time lost, the implied NDR rate is 3pps :)\n\nBottom line, more description of the graphs themselves would be very useful!",
