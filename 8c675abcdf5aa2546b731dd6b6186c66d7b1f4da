      "message": "Per latest understanding of network topology, it would be best to collapse IPv4 address space to a single subnet.  Not sure if it would be better move 10.30.51.xx addresses to 10.32.8.xx or the reverse.\n\nChanging 10.30.51.xx addresses as part of the Stage-2 move would require less downtime at the cost of changing more addresses.\n\nNote: it looks like this only pertains to host addresses.  From the data here, Ipmi addresses appear to already be in the same IPv4 subnet.",
