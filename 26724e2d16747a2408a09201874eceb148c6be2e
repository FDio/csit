Would that be a useful functional test?), we should add the parameter or return all keys without logging it (which I prefer, but don\u0027t know if it\u0027s possible).\n\nIf we can\u0027t think of a use for it, I\u0027ll leave it as is.",

If we use the argument and set it to 0 by default, we won\u0027t need the dummy keys, right? That may be a more elegant solution (as it could be co-opted for other uses).
