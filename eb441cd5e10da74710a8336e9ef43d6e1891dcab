      "message": "The result of time() attempts to be close to calendar time, while the results of monotonic() attempt to give correct time differences. When a device is heavily out of sync with the external world, and then abruptly synchronizes (e.g. using NTP protocol), it is possible for time() result to jump forward or back, so for correct ordering monotonic() is more reliable. But monotonic() is less reliable when ordering events happening at different devices.\n\nBased on the two quotes from https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/blob/main/specification/OpenMetrics.md\nI think we want to use monotonic() instead of time() in this file.\n\n\"If more than one MetricPoint is exposed for a Metric, then its MetricPoints MUST have monotonically increasing timestamps.\"\n\n\"Time synchronization is a hard problem and data should be internally consistent in each system. As such, ingestors should be able to attach the current timestamp from their perspective to data rather than based on the system time of the exposer device.\"",

Use time at the current add_sample call (needs None as default, and getting time in method body).\n2. Raise exception as number of arguments does not match (by not giving a default for timestamp argument) to force the call site to choose their timestamp value.\n3. Use time of metrics.py being imported (the current implementation with function call as the default).\n\nActually, I am not sure about the exact interpreter behavior. Maybe the current implementation sets the time of first ever add_sample call, which still may be seven suites ago, just few seconds later than the actual import.\n\nWe can debate whether 1. or 2. is the best, but I do not see how 3. could be the best.\n\n\u003e L44 L56 are times when value is actually set or inc\n\nYes, but this comment thread is only relevant for call sites (currently none) which skip the timestamp argument.",
