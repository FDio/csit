      "message": "I added sleep 5 here as a quick measure.\n\nWhen \"service vpp restart\" exits, vpp is not yet fully initialized (DPDK init hasn\u0027t started yet), leading to the possibility of the race condition happening, hence the sleep.\n\nI tried 3 second, but I still observed the i40e issue (I looked at other jobs (without this lock) that could interfere, but there were none, suggesting that sleep 3 is insufficient). With 10 seconds, I didn\u0027t see it. I\u0027m trying 5 seconds now.\n\nIt\u0027s possible that we need something better than simple sleep, but that may be unnecessarily complicated for what is supposed to be a workaround. Something like locking the dir/file in a separate thread and unlocking after all the checks are done.",
