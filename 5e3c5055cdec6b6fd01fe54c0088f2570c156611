      "message": "CSIT was designed around few major principles:\n1) Internet ethiquette to not downloading everything from intefernet for every test case, saving the bandwidth and of course other things. I like this apprach thus i have been thinking on another approach to this\n2) Complete freeze of system. To make testing efficient and effective and deteministic you need to freeze anything that could have impact on stability and focus on verify CSIT/VPP code. Not debuging all the dependencies. (not only PIP, but also APT/YUM). This way CSIT code is very stable with very low rate of failures. Also APT/YUM is not changing so we cannot blame TB OS/packages for perf because simply they did not change since installation of TB. We are in PIP offline so no package will pass without our knowledge although few improvements like pip freeze are possible. Very important thing is that we do not need to care about between patch changes of TB as it is fully controlled. COnsistent state is very important.\n3) Optimization. Having PIP be installed every time it also consumes time. I would prefer to PIP packages be created on machine directly in virtualenv to avoid using internet connection.",

Looking at a console output [0], I see two kinds of download (from Internet to Jenkins executor):\n\n  02:05:46  Get:26 http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-updates/main amd64 Packages [796 kB]\n  02:06:21    Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ee/cd/d20c1e121b09697bf4d7b1b9edde6573fc7d54eefc56860f457a7edfc0de/scapy-2.3.1.zip (1.1MB)\n\n\u003e Complete freeze of system.\n\u003e This way CSIT code is very stable\n\nI agree, we should fix everything we do not want to change. But sometimes we want to change some things in the middle of the release cycle. Typically the things we want to change are in CSIT git repo. Packages listed in this file do not affect the VPP performance, but they limit what can we use for driving the tests and for initial processing of the results.\n\n\u003e we do not need to care about between patch changes of TB\n\u003e as it is fully controlled\n\nFor the test to work, we need a machine to run VPP (SUT), a machinde to run Trex (TG) and a machine to run Robot (no acronym). Is the Robot machine the part of testbed, or is it outside (as Jenkis and Nexus)?\nAlso, we are already allowing some flexibility for utilities such as traffic profiles.\n\n\u003e I would prefer to PIP packages be created on machine\n\u003e directly in virtualenv to avoid using internet connection.\n\nWe can use the executor to download package archive from Internet (or approproate LF cache), push it where needed, and pip install there from the archive file.\n\n\u003e Full automated and unattended CI/CD.\n\u003e This principle must be met.\n\nThis principle is not met for changes which affect virl images.\nIt is not clear which type of change does require automatic verification, and which does not.\n\n\u003e no manual intervention during gerrit verify\n\nIf there is a manual \"script\" to follow, it can be scripted (assuming we deal with various credentials).\nAt least I think the manual \"script\" can be made deterministic enough to not require any intelligent agent.\nSo, I believe automatic process can be created. I am just not sure if it is worth the time right now, as the number of edits to verify will be quite low for 1807.\n\n[0] https://logs.fd.io/production/vex-yul-rot-jenkins-1/csit-vpp-perf-mrr-daily-master/180/console-timestamp.log.gz",
