      "message": "How will the trending handle the graphs. Do we want -2n- to be in graph\u0027s name? If yes, the testcase name could be tc01-64B-1c-2n-ethip4-ip4base-mrr. And autogeneration script would create that if this suite name is 10ge2p1x710-2n-ethip4-ip4base-mrr.robot\n\nBut I guess NIC name is in graph name while not in testcase name, so this comment is irrelevant.\n\nAnyway, 2n as part of \"2n10ge2p1x710\" looks ugly to me. Was there a discussion about how to fit testbed size into our naming schemes?",

Was there a\n \u003e discussion about how to fit testbed size into our naming schemes?\n\nInitial discussion [1] did not encounter this. However we sort of discuss with Tibor. The outcome is to have some sort of scheme top-down left-right. So as per [1] i think node topo will preceede NIC, but i agree it might not be script friendly. as ten it goes to packet and vpp processing. 2n1l-10ge2p1x710? 2node single link?\n\nhaving it in the middle looks little bit out of nowhere like nobody read what does 2n mean\n\nStill some time to decide the final naming...\n\n[1] https://wiki.fd.io/view/CSIT/csit-test-naming",
