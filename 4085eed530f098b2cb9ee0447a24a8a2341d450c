      "message": "How will the trending handle the graphs. Do we want -2n- to be in graph\u0027s name? If yes, the testcase name could be tc01-64B-1c-2n-ethip4-ip4base-mrr. And autogeneration script would create that if this suite name is 10ge2p1x710-2n-ethip4-ip4base-mrr.robot\n\nBut I guess NIC name is in graph name while not in testcase name, so this comment is irrelevant.\n\nAnyway, 2n as part of \"2n10ge2p1x710\" looks ugly to me. Was there a discussion about how to fit testbed size into our naming schemes?",
