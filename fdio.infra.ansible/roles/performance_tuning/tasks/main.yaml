  # malloc, directly by mmap and mprotect, and also when loading shared
  # libraries.
  #
  # while most applications need less than a thousand maps, certain
  # programs, particularly malloc debuggers, may consume lots of them,
  # e.g., up to one or two maps per allocation.
  # must be greater than or equal to (2 * vm.nr_hugepages).

  # brought online, the watchdog will be started based on the mask value.

  # to re-enable cores that by default were not running the watchdog,
