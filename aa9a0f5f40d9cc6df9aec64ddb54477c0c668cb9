IoW why you need to switch between runs and recompile?\nIf NGINX is being part of DUT development (that means changing its internal code, like vpp development) then it must have a jenkins ci/cd pipeline to do that and build such artefacts.\n\n\u003e I may be able to introduce some non-ansible way to skip compilation when the compiler artifact should be equivalent to the already existing one.\n\nThat does not work. And i will vote -1 as well. You already assume opposite in your first sentence. So read after yourself.\n\n\u003e the installation directory should not be the one that always [0] gets wiped everytime a run starts.\n\nthis assumes mapped storage (in fd.io we use an jenkins job abstraction for that). If the NGINX is being pathed, we cannot declare it as a NGINX but dirty copy and that requires either statically installed binary (e.g dirty/non-dirty if only 2 exists) or jenkins job abstraction. But for sure not in CSIT code.",
