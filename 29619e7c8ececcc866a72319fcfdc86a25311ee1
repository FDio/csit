The weekly running one is (symlinked to) docs/job_specs/report_iterative/3n-icx/vpp-ndrpdr-00.md.\n\nAnyway, I was also confused and did not realize docs/job_specs/mrr_weekly/vpp-3n-icx.md defines the nfv_density tests. So it should be there (waiting for job), but the other VPP symlinks in docs/job_specs/mrr_weekly/ should be removed instead (as we already have mrr_daily symlinking to the same report_iterative jobspecs and runnig in daily jobs).",
