# DISCLAIMER: BEFORE EDITING THIS FILE!
#
# This file has two closely related consequences.
# The common part is that this file defines
# the content of virtual Python environment
# used when Robot tests are running.
# The difference is in which machine the environment is created on.
# For the Jenkins executor machines,
# editing this file has no surprising consequences.
#
# But the environment is also being created
# on virtual machines created by VIRL, which do have specific restrictions.
# Complete package and setting snapshot (for both VIRL and Physical Testbed),
# with network being limited in case of VIRL to local only.
# This implies pip currently being set to site-packages only
# for both VIRL and Physical Testbed.
# So if the "virl image" applied on the machine
# does not reflect the edits, some installations might fail.
# Even if the failure may not directly impact execution,
# this leads into inconsistency between installed environment
# and the code base which may lead into fatal error or uncaught exceptions.
#
# The "virl image" is built from files such as
# resources/tools/disk-image-builder/ubuntu/lists/ubuntu-16.04.1_2017-10-21_2.0/pip-requirements.txt
# but the build is not automated,
# the new "virl image" has to be built and applied manually
# before your edit can pass.
# This also means, incompatible virl images
# would make existing tests fail until your edit is merged.
#
# TODO: Automate the virtualenv download and distribution
#   on all types of testbeds prior the test execution.
# TODO: Figure out a way to verify edits to this file automatically.
