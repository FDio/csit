# DISCLAIMER: BEFORE EDITING THIS FILE!
#
# This file has two closely related consequences. The common part is that this
# file defines the content of virtual Python environment used when Robot tests
# are running.
#
# But the virtual environment is also being created on containerized
# environment created by either Nomad cluster (Jenkins, vpp_device) or during
# execution on SUT machines, which might have specific restrictions.
#
# Complete package and setting snapshot (for all container images),
# with network being limited to local only. This implies pip currently being
# set to site-packages only. So if the "container image" applied on the machine
# does not reflect the edits, some installations might fail.
# Even if the failure may not directly impact execution, this leads into
# inconsistency between installed environment and the code base which may lead
# into fatal error or uncaught exceptions.
