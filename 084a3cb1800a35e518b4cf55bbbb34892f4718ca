      "message": "We need to rework these in order to unify suites for various drivers and also to be able to remove dpdk_plugin entirely\n\ndpdk_plugin is mandatory now due to DPDK sections in default startup conf and also RXQ / no-mulitseg / and few others. To be able to introduce pre-initialize layer driver we need to remove RXQ from L72 create new KW \"Pre-initialize layer driver | ${nic_driver}\" and put all DPDK sections into it. Then Apply Startup can be called.\n\nThis way we can fully automate AVF/RDMA suite generator just by altering nic_driver/nic_name",
