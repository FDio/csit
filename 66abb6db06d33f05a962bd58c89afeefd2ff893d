I have had issues going back \u0026 forth between TCP/WRK tests and TCP/Iperf tests due to insufficient cleanup causing linux driver bind/unbind hanging... \n\nIn any case, I\u0027ll move this to roles/common/tasks/ubuntu_bionic.yaml",

      "message": "\u003e Should I add -tps\n\nThroughput is already in some units (bits, bytes, packets) per second, so -tps does not really make sense.\n-bps makes sense (depending on which units are actually reported).\n\n\u003e to the tox checker\n\nTo autogen. The minimal edit will be at this [1] line, but the issue is (as I mentioned elsewhere) this suite has different testcase arguments. I see two possibilities.\nYou can hardcode parallel\u003d8 (and time\u003d60) in local template (e.g. not testing parallel\u003d1), that way write_tcp_files will do its job correctly.\nOr you can add a new factory method to Testcase.py, add a new kwargs list (to use instead of tcp_kwargs_list) and either add new methods (write_bps_files and add_bps_testcases), or (preferably) make the existing methods (write_tcp_files and add_tcp_testcases) configurable, so they accept both factories.\n\n[1] https://github.com/FDio/csit/blob/d68951ac245150eeefa6e0f4156e4c1b5c9e9325/resources/libraries/python/autogen/Regenerator.py#L357",
