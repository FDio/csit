    Gather data into groups with average as trend value.

    The jumpavg library is known to give wrong classification (too many groups)
    when the values are too close to zero, and offers a "unit" parameter
    to compensate. Throughput works well with 1.0, but telemetry
    (especially cache misses) need value of 0.01 as VPP reports values
    rounded to a multiple of that.
