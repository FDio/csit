help-cmp-parameter:
  The parameter to be used for comparison.
help-cmp-value:
  The value of parameter to be used for comparison.
help-cores:
  Number of cores the DUT uses during the test.
help-csit-dut:

  Device under Test (the rest).
help-data-type:
  The type of collected data.
help-download:
  Download the selected data as a csv file.
help-dut:
  Device Under Test (DUT) - In software networking, “device” denotes a specific

help-framesize:
  Frame size - size of an Ethernet Layer-2 frame on the wire, including any VLAN
  tags (dot1q, dot1ad) and Ethernet FCS, but excluding Ethernet preamble and
  inter-frame gap. Measured in Bytes.
help-infra:
  Infrastructure is defined by the toplology (number of nodes), processor
  architecture, NIC and driver.
help-measurement:
  The measured quantity in interest.
help-normalize:
  Normalize the results to CPU frequency 2GHz. The results from AWS environment
  are not normalized as we do not know the exact value of CPU frequency.
help-release:
  The CSIT release.

  If selected, the latency is included in tables.
help-tbed:
  The test bed is defined by toplology (number of nodes) and processor
  architecture.
help-test:
  The test specification consists of packet encapsulation, VPP packet processing
  (packet forwarding mode and packet processing function(s)) and packet
  forwarding path.
help-ttype:
  Main measured variable.
help-url:
  URL with current configuration. If there is no "Copy URL" button, use triple
