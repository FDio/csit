      "message": "Is this the addition of e810cq 2p100Gbe NIC and associated dpdk and avf driver combinations that increased the test job execution? \n\n2n-clx have already been running x710-avf, x710-dpdk, xxv710-avf, xxv710-dpdk and cx556a-rdma-core combinations.\n\nBTW before this change vpp-mlr-00.md contains 442 tests, so 660min / 442 \u003d 1.5min avg time per test for MRR test job, 2400min / 442 \u003d 5.4min avg time per test for NDRPDR test job. Is this what you see for other testbeds?",
