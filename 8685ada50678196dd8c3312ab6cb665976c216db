      "message": "Well, I could be convinced that \"constant\" means \"immutable after initialization\", and that \"initialization\" does not need to be static, and side effects such as reading from file can have benefits (e.g. when accessing already established source of truth).\n\nBut in this specific case, files such as VPP_DEVICE_IMAGE_UBUNTU should have contents immutable at runtime. Otherwise it is just a question of time until somebody contributes an accidental edit.",
