This directory (and its subdirectories)
contain files that have to be distributed under GPL license,
mostly because of linking with scapy.

When migrating more files here, make sure to migrate
also everything linking with them.

Currently the license listed is still Apache 2.0,
we are waiting for sign-offs as described in
https://wiki.fd.io/view/TSC/Relicensing_Procedure
before we switch the licenses.
