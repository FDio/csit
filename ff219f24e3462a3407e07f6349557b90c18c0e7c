But the name of a complete program will be something like \"CSIT packet analyzer script for test X\" or \"CSIT configured TRex client for test Y\", which would be unwieldy in the notice text (not to mention the work with substituting for X and Y).\n\nGPL license is always related to a \"software\" or \"program\". The notice used here implies the terms apply to each program of which that particular file is a (linked) part.\n\n[0] https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.en.html",
