Perhaps even recommend which (primary) quantities should be given in test definition, and which (secondary) quantities are to be computed from them for comparison reasons.\n\nFor example, our suite names contain the total number of memif endpoints (secondary quantity in my view).\nAnd our current testsuite code needs both of these two lines:\n  | ${nf_dtcr}\u003d | ${2}\n  | ${nf_dtc}\u003d | ${0.5}\nto specify NF-0.5c is used.",
