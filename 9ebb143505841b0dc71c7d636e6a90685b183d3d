      "message": "Speaking about documentation, I have noticed that log.html only shows first line [0]. As opposed to showing full suite documentation. I guess it is caused by the suite documentation having escaped endlines.\n\nDo we want to have full keyword documentation visible in log.html, is are the one-lines considered a feature? In the latter case, we should apply rules similar to commit messages, so that the one visible line is gramatically correct.\n\n[0] https://logs.fd.io/production/vex-yul-rot-jenkins-1/csit-vpp-perf-verify-master-3n-hsw/21/archives/log.html.gz#s1-s1-s1-s1-s1-t1-k2",
