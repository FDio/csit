## Tests for NAT44ED

Three types of stateful tests are developed for NAT44ED (source network address
and port translation IPv4 to IPv4 with 5-tuple session state):

- Connections-Per-Second (CPS), discovering the maximum rate of creating
  NAT44ED sessions. Measured separately for UDP and TCP connections and
  for different session scale.

- Packets-Per-Second (PPS), discovering the maximum rate of
  simultaneously creating NAT44ED sessions and transfering bulk of data
  packets across the corresponding connections. Measured separately for
  UDP and TCP connections with different session scale and different
  data packet sizes per each connection.

This note describes CPS tests.

## CPS Test Objectives

Discover DUT's highest sustain rate of creating fully functional NAT44ED
5-tuple stateful session entries. Session entry is considered fully
functional, if packets associated with this entry are NAT44ED processed
by DUT and forwarded in both directions without loss.

Similarly to packet throughput tests, three CPS rates are discovered:

- CPS-MRR, verified connection rate at maximal connection attempt rate               maximum receive rate for CPS, regardless of connection loss
  (connections not established).
- CPS-NDR, maximal connection attempt rate                      non-drop rate for CPS, with zero connection loss.
- CPS-PDR, maximal connection attempt rate                      partial drop rate for CPS, with configured connection loss
  ratio.

## Input Parameters

- `max_cps_rate`, maximum rate of attempting connections, to be used by
  traffic generator, limited by traffic generator capabilities, Ethernet
  link(s) rate and NIC model.
- `min_cps_rate`, minimum rate of establishing connections to be used for
  measurements. Search fails if lower transmit rate needs to be used to
  meet search criteria.
- `target_session_number`, maximum number of sessions to be established and
  tested.
- `target_loss_ratio`, maximum acceptable connections loss ratio search
  criteria for PDR measurements with UDP tests. Indicates packet drop
  impact on connection establishment rate.
- `final_relative_width`, required measurement resolution expressed as
  (lower_bound, upper_bound) interval width relative to upper_bound.
- stateful traffic profiles, TRex ASTF program defining the connection
  per L4 protocol tested (TCP, UDP), including connect and
  close sequence.

## Stateful traffic profiles

TRex ASTF program defines following TCP and UDP transactions for
discovering NAT44ED CPS limits:

- CPS with TCP
  - connect(syn,syn-ack,ack)
    - pkts client tx 2, rx 1
    - pkts server tx 1, rx 2
  - delay (note: optional, currently not implemented)
    - no packets
  - close(fin,fin-ack,ack,ack)
    - pkts client tx 2, rx 2
    - pkts server tx 1, rx 2
- CPS with UDP
  - connect_and_close(req,ack)
    - pkts client tx 1, rx 1
    - pkts server tx 1, rx 1

TRex ASTF program configuration parameters:

- `limit` of connections, set to `max_session_number`.
- `multiplier`, target number of transactions per second to be executed.
  Multiplier applies to connect phase. Close phases is initiated
  automatically based on arrival of the last expected packet.
- IPv4 source and destination address and port ranges matching the
  limit of connections.
  - Source and destination addresses changing packet-by-packet with two
    separate profiles i) incrementing sequentially pair-wise
    (implemented) and ii) changed randomly (with seed) pair-wise (not
    implemented yet).
  - Source port changing randomly within the range.
- `trial_duration`, function of `max_session_number` and `multiplier`
  - `multiplier`, subject of the search, value in the range (`min_cps_rate`,`max_cps_rate`)
  - `target_setup_duration` = `max_session_number` / `trial_cps_rate`
  - For UDP:
    - `trial_duration` = `target_setup_duration` + `cool_down_delay`
    - `cool_down_delay` = `target_setup_duration` * 0.2 (TODO Vratko to confirm)
  - For TCP:
    - `trial_duration` = 2 * `target_setup_duration` + `cool_down_delay`
    - `cool_down_delay` = `target_setup_duration` * 0.4 (TODO Vratko to confirm)

## UDP CPS Tests

### UDP TRex Measurements

results evaluation (r) and debugging purposes (d):

[TRex ASTF counters reference](https://trex-tgn.cisco.com/trex/doc/trex_astf.html#_counters_reference).

TRex counters are polled once TRex confirms traffic is stopped, after it
is explicitly instructed to stop it. Early attempts to use periodic TRex
counter polling affected TRex behaviour and test results, hence counter
polling is consider as invasive.

#### Calculations

- Interface packet loss
  - pktloss_ratio = (c_opackets - c_ipackets) / c_opackets
- UDP session packet loss (currently not used)
- UDP session byte loss (currently not used)
- UDP session integrity (currently not used)

#### CPS-MRR

Reported MRR values are equal to the following TRex counters from
Target-Counters:

- `c_m_est_flows`
- `s_m_est_flows`

In order to ensure a determnistic region of TRex ASTF operation, a
separate set of tests is run for each traffic profile, with vpp-ip4base
DUT instead of vpp-nat44ed. Result of this is test is used as a safe
CPS-MTR value (Maximum Transmit Rate) to be used for CPS-MRR tests.

#### CPS-PDR

CPS-PDR values are discovered using MLRsearch, a binary search optimized
for the overall test duration.

CPS-PDR = `multiplier` * `c_ipackets` / `expected_c_opackets`,
with `pktloss_ratio` < `target_loss_ratio`

`expected_c_opackets` = ? (TODO)

Measurements to be reported in the CPS-PDR result test message:

- `trial_cps_rate`
- `c_m_est_flows`
- `s_m_est_flows`

#### CPS-NDR

CPS-NDR values are discovered using MLRsearch, a binary search optimized
for the overall test duration.

CPS-NDR = `trial_cps_rate`, if all of the following conditions are met:

- `udp_failed_connection_count` = 0
- `udp_pktloss_ratio` = 0
- `pktloss_ratio` = 0

Measurements to be reported in the CPS-PDR result test message:

- `trial_cps_rate`
- `c_m_est_flows`
- `s_m_est_flows`

[TRex ASTF counters reference](https://trex-tgn.cisco.com/trex/doc/trex_astf.html#_counters_reference).

TRex counters polled periodically by CSIT python code every 1 sec
interval. (TODO: Shall we also consider more frequent polling e.g. every
0.5 sec ?)

Counter values evaluated for two specific sets read from TRex:

- Target-Counters: Counters collected at the lowest value of
  `c_m_traffic_duration` conforming with (`c_m_traffic_duration` >
  `target_setup_duration`).
- Final-Counters: Final cumulative counters after trial ends.

Note: Target-Counters are used for CPS test results evaluations, unless
otherwise stated.

#### Calculations

- Interface packet loss
  - `pktloss_c_s` = `c_opackets` - `s_ipackets`
  - `pktloss_s_c` = `s_opackets` - `c_ipackets`
  - `pktloss_ratio` = (`pktloss_s_c` + `pktloss_c_s`) / (`c_opackets` + `s_opackets`)
- TCP session integrity
  - `tcp_attempted_connection_count` = `c_tcps_connattempt`
  - `tcp_failed_connection_count` = `c_tcps_connects` - `c_tcps_connattempt`

#### CPS Trial PASS

PASS of TCP CPS test trial is conditioned on all of the following criteria being met:

- PASS-C1 TRex must attempt all configured `max_session_number` in `target_setup_duration` time
   - IOW TRex must send connect packets at configured `trial_cps_rate`.
- PASS-C2 Following TRex errors ARE NOT recorded in Target-Counters:
  - Traffic Client
    - No errors recorded so far
  - Traffic Server
    - `err_no_template`, server canât match L7 template no destination port or IP range

#### CPS-MRR

Reported MRR values are equal to the following TRex counters from Target-Counters:
- `c_m_est_flows`
- `s_m_est_flows`

TODO Add description of separate set of tests for discovering a **safe**
CPS-MTR value (Maximum Transmit Rate) for TRex, where TRex errors **are not**
observed in Target-Counters.

#### CPS-PDR

CPS-PDR values are discovered using MLRsearch, a binary search optimized
for the overall test duration.

CPS-PDR = `trial_cps_rate`, if all of the following conditions are met:

- `tcp_failed_connection_count` < `target_loss_ratio`
- `pktloss_ratio` < `target_loss_ratio`

Measurements to be reported in the CPS-PDR result test message:

- `trial_cps_rate`
- `c_m_est_flows`
- `s_m_est_flows`

#### CPS-NDR

CPS-NDR values are discovered using MLRsearch, a binary search optimized
for the overall test duration.

CPS-NDR = `trial_cps_rate`, if all of the following conditions are met:

- `tcp_failed_connection_count` = 0
- `pktloss_ratio` = 0

Measurements to be reported in the CPS-PDR result test message:

- `trial_cps_rate`
- `c_m_est_flows`
