## Tests for NAT44-ED

Three types of tests are developed for NAT44-ED (source network address
and port translation IPv4 to IPv4 with 5-tuple session state):

- Connections-Per-Second (CPS), discovering the maximum rate of creating
  NAT44-ED sessions. Measured separately for UDP and TCP connections and
  for different session scale.

- Transactions-Per-Second (TPS), discovering the maximum rate of
  simultaneously creating NAT44-ED sessions and transfering bulk data
  across the corresponding connections. Measured separately for UDP and
  TCP connections, different session scale and different sizes of bulk
  data transactions per each connection.

- Packet throughput, discovering the maximum sustained throughput rate
  of packet data after creating NAT44-ED sessions, without packet and
  data loss (non-drop rate, NDR) and with partial packet and data loss
  (partial drop rate, PDR). PDR measured for configured packet loss
  ratio (PLR) and byte loss ratio (BLR). Measured separately for UDP and
  TCP connections, different session scale and different sizes of bulk
  data transactions per each connection. Connection goodput reported for
  NDR and PDR packet throughput rates.

This note describes CPS.

## CPS Test Objectives

Discover DUT's highest sustain rate of creating fully functional NAT44ED
5-tuple stateful session entries. Session entry is considered fully
functional, if packets associated with this entry are NAT44ED processed
and forwarded in both directions without loss.

Similarly to packet throughput, three CPS rates are discovered:

- CPS-MRR, maximum receive rate for CPS, regardless of connections loss
  (connections not established).
- CPS-NDR, non-drop rate for CPS, with zero connections loss.
- CPS-PDR, partial drop rate for CPS, with configured connections loss
  ratio.

## Input Parameters

- `max_cps_rate`, maximum rate of establishing connections, to be used by
  traffic generator, limited by traffic generator capabilities, Ethernet
  link(s) rate and NIC model.
- `min_cps_rate`, minimum rate of establishing connections to be used for
  measurements. Search fails if lower transmit rate needs to be used to
  meet search criteria.
- `max_session_number`, maximum number of sessions to be established and
  tested.
- `target_loss_ratio`, maximum acceptable connections loss ratio search
  criteria for PDR measurements with UDP tests. Indicates packet drop
  impact on connection establishment rate.
- `final_relative_width`, required measurement resolution expressed as
  (lower_bound, upper_bound) interval width relative to upper_bound.
- TRex ASTF program, defining the CPS transaction per L4 protocol
  tested, including connect sequence (TCP, UDP), delay, close sequence,
  delay. Delay phases are required to account for successfully
  established and closed connections with associated packet and connection
  counters.

## TRex ASTF Program

TRex ASTF program defines following transactions for separate TCP and
UDP tests for discovering CPS limits:

- CPS with TCP
  - connect(syn,syn-ack,ack),
    - pkts client tx 2, rx 1
    - pkts server tx 1, rx 2
  - delay,
    - no packets
  - close(fin,fin-ack,ack,ack)
    - pkts client tx 2, rx 2
    - pkts server tx 1, rx 2
  - delay,
    - no packets
- CPS with UDP
  - connect_and_close(req,ack),
    - pkts client tx 1, rx 1
    - pkts server tx 1, rx 1
  - delay,
    - no packets

TRex ASTF program configuration parameters:

- `limit` of connections, set to `max_session_number`.
- `multiplier`, target number of transactions per second to be executed.
  Multiplier applies to connect and close phases.
- IPv4 source and destination address and port ranges matching the
  limit of connections.
  - Source and destination address changing packet-by-packet with two
    separate profiles i) incrementing sequentially pair-wise and ii)
    changed randomly (with seed) pair-wise.
  - Source port changing randomly within the range.
- `trial_duration`, function of `max_session_number` and `trial_cps_rate`
  - `trial_cps_rate`, subject of the search, value in the range (`min_cps_rate`,`max_cps_rate`)
  - `target_setup_duration` = `max_session_number` / `trial_cps_rate`
  - For UDP:
    - `trial_duration` = `target_setup_duration` + `cool_down_delay`
    - `cool_down_delay` = `target_setup_duration` * 0.2 (TODO Vratko to confirm)
  - For TCP:
    - `trial_duration` = 2 * `target_setup_duration` + `cool_down_delay`
    - `cool_down_delay` = `target_setup_duration` * 0.4 (TODO Vratko to confirm)

TRex counters are polled periodically by CSIT python code every 1 sec
interval. (TODO: Shall we also consider more frequent polling e.g. every
0.5 sec ?)

Two specific sets of TRex counters are used for test results evaluation:

- Target-Counters: Counters collected at the lowest value of
  `c_m_traffic_duration` conforming with (`c_m_traffic_duration` >
  `target_setup_duration`).
- Final-Counters: Final cumulative counters after trial ends.

Note: Target-Counters are used for CPS test results evaluations, unless
otherwise stated.

#### Calculations

- Interface packet loss
  - `pktloss_c_s` = `c_opackets` - `s_ipackets`
  - `pktloss_s_c` = `s_opackets` - `c_ipackets`
  - `pktloss_ratio` = (`pktloss_s_c` + `pktloss_c_s`) / (`c_opackets` + `s_opackets`)
- UDP session packet loss
  - `udp_pktloss_c_s` = `c_udps_sndpkt` - `s_udps_rcvpkt`
  - `udp_pktloss_s_c` = `s_udps_sndpkt` - `c_udps_rcvpkt`
  - `udp_pktloss_ratio` = (`udp_pktloss_s_c` + `udp_pktloss_c_s`) / (`c_udps_sndpkt` + `s_udps_sndpkt`)
- UDP session byte loss
  - `udp_byteloss_c_s` = `c_udps_sndbyte` - `s_udps_rcvbyte`
  - `udp_byteloss_s_c` = `s_udps_sndbyte` - `c_udps_rcvbyte`
  - `udp_byteloss_ratio` = (`udp_byteloss_s_c` + `udp_byteloss_c_s`) / (`c_udps_sndbyte` + `s_udps_sndbyte`)
- UDP session integrity
  - `udp_attempted_connection_count` = `c_udps_connects`
