Documentation for tags used to select and identify test cases.

List of TAGs and their descriptions
===================================

Topology TAGs
-------------

3_NODE_DOUBLE_LINK_TOPO
    3 nodes connected in a circular topology with two links interconnecting
    the devices.

3_NODE_SINGLE_LINK_TOPO
    3 nodes connected in a circular topoloty with at least one link
    interconnecting devices.

Objective TAGs
--------------

Environment TAGs
----------------

HW_ENV
    DUTs and TGs are running on bare metal.

VM_ENV
    DUTs and TGs are running in virtual environment.

VPP_VM_ENV
    DUTs with VPP and capable of running Virtual Machine.

DUT Setup TAGs
--------------

1_THREAD_NOHTT_RSS_1
    1 worker thread pinned to dedicated core without use of Hyper-threading
    technology with 1 thread per interface. Main thread pinned to core 0.

2_THREAD_NOHTT_RSS_1
    2 worker threads each pinned to dedicated core without use of Hyper-threading
    technology with 1 thread per interface. Main thread pinned to core 0.

4_THREAD_NOHTT_RSS_2
    4 worker threads each pinned to dedicated core without use of Hyper-threading
    technology with 2 threads per interface. Main thread pinned to core 0.

6_THREAD_NOHTT_RSS_3
    6 worker threads each pinned to dedicated core without use of Hyper-threading
    technology with 3 threads per interface. Main thread pinned to core 0.

8_THREAD_HTT_RSS_4
    8 worker threads each pinned to dedicated core without use of Hyper-threading
    technology with 4 threads per interface. Main thread pinned to core 0.

SINGLE_THREAD
    All single threaded test cases.

MULTI_THREAD
    All test cases with more then one thread.

Performance testing TAGs
------------------------

PERFTEST
    All performance test cases.

PERFTEST_SHORT
    Performance of DUT should pass specific value. Each test case run is
    executed for 10 seconds.

PERFTEST_LONG
    Find performance of DUT based on RFC2544 with linear/binary/combined
    search. Each test case run is executed for 60 seconds.

PDR
    Partial Drop Rate evaluation of single run result. Loss acceptance of
    dropped packets from number of sent packet is set as variable in frames or
    percentage.

NDR
    Non Drop Rate evaluation of results. Loss acceptance of dropped packets is
    set to zero lost packets.
