<?line 64?>

<t>This document proposes extensions to RFC 2544 throughput search by
defining a new methodology called Multiple Loss Ratio search
(MLRsearch). MLRsearch aims to minimize search duration,
support multiple loss ratio searches,
and enhance result repeatability and comparability.</t>

<t>The primary reason for extending RFC 2544 is to address the challenges
of evaluating and testing the data planes of software-based networking systems.</t>

<t>To give users more freedom, MLRsearch provides additional configuration options
such as allowing multiple short trials per load instead of one large trial,
tolerating a certain percentage of trial results with higher loss,
and supporting the search for multiple goals with varying loss ratios.</t>

<xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="purpose-and-scope"><name>Purpose and Scope</name>

<t>The purpose of this document is to describe the Multiple Loss Ratio search
(MLRsearch) methodology, optimized for determining
data plane throughput in software-based networking devices and functions.</t>

<t>Applying the vanilla <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> throughput bisection method to software DUTs
results in several problems:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Binary search takes too long as most trials are done far from the
eventually found throughput.</t>
  <t>The required final trial duration and pauses between trials
prolong the overall search duration.</t>
  <t>Software DUTs show noisy trial results,
leading to a big spread of possible discovered throughput values.</t>
  <t>Throughput requires a loss of exactly zero frames, but the industry
frequently allows for low but non-zero losses.</t>
  <t>The definition of throughput is not clear when trial results are inconsistent.</t>
</list></t>

<t>To address these problems,
the MLRsearch test methodology employs the following enhancements:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Allow multiple short trials instead of one big trial per load.
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Optionally, tolerate a percentage of trial results with higher loss.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Allow searching for multiple Search Goals, with differing loss ratios.
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Any trial result can affect each Search Goal in principle.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Insert multiple coarse targets for each Search Goal, earlier ones need
to spend less time on trials.
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Earlier targets also aim for lesser precision.</t>
      <t>Use Forwarding Rate (FR) at maximum offered load
<xref target="RFC2285"></xref> (Section 3.6.2) to initialize bounds.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Take care when dealing with inconsistent trial results.
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Reported throughput is smaller than the smallest load with high loss.</t>
      <t>Smaller load candidates are measured first.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Apply several load selection heuristics to save even more time
by trying hard to avoid unnecessarily narrow bounds.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Some of these enhancements are formalized as MLRsearch specification,
the remaining enhancements are treated as implementation details,
thus achieving high comparability without limiting future improvements.</t>

<t>MLRsearch configuration options are flexible enough to
support both conservative settings and aggressive settings.
Conservative enough settings lead to results
unconditionally compliant with <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>,
but without much improvement on search duration and repeatability.
Conversely, aggressive settings lead to shorter search durations
and better repeatability, but the results are not compliant with <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>.</t>

<t>No part of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> is intended to be obsoleted by this document.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="identified-problems"><name>Identified Problems</name>

<t>This chapter describes the problems affecting usability
of various performance testing methodologies,
mainly a binary search for <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> unconditionally compliant throughput.</t>

<section anchor="long-search-duration"><name>Long Search Duration</name>

<t>The emergence of software DUTs, with frequent software updates and a
number of different frame processing modes and configurations,
has increased both the number of performance tests
required to verify the DUT update and the frequency of running those tests.
This makes the overall test execution time even more important than before.</t>

<t>The current <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> throughput definition restricts the potential
for time-efficiency improvements.
A more generalized throughput concept could enable further enhancements
while maintaining the precision of simpler methods.</t>

<t>The bisection method, when used in a manner unconditionally compliant
with <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>, is excessively slow.</t>

<t>This is because a significant amount of time is spent on trials
with loads that, in retrospect, are far from the final determined throughput.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC2544"></xref> does not specify any stopping condition for throughput search,
so users already have an access to a limited trade-off
between search duration and achieved precision.
However, each of the full 60-second trials doubles the precision,
so not many trials can be removed without a substantial loss of precision.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="dut-in-sut"><name>DUT in SUT</name>

<t><xref target="RFC2285"></xref> defines:</t>

<t>DUT as:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The network frame forwarding device to which stimulus is offered and
response measured <xref target="RFC2285"></xref> (Section 3.1.1).</t>
</list></t>

<t>SUT as:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The collective set of network devices as a single entity to which
stimulus is offered and response measured <xref target="RFC2285"></xref> (Section 3.1.2).</t>
</list></t>

<t><xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section 19) specifies a test setup
with an external tester stimulating the networking system,
treating it either as a single DUT, or as a system of devices, an SUT.</t>

<t>In the case of software networking, the SUT consists of not only the DUT
as a software program processing frames, but also of
server hardware and operating system functions,
with that server hardware resources shared across all programs including
the operating system.</t>

<t>Given that the SUT is a shared multi-tenant environment
encompassing the DUT and other components, the DUT might inadvertently
experience interference from the operating system
or other software operating on the same server.</t>

<t>Some of this interference can be mitigated.
For instance, pinning DUT program threads to specific CPU cores
and isolating those cores can prevent context switching.</t>

<t>Despite taking all feasible precautions, some adverse effects may still impact
the DUT&#39;s network performance.
In this document, these effects are collectively
referred to as SUT noise, even if the effects are not as unpredictable
as what other engineering disciplines call noise.</t>

<t>DUT can also exhibit fluctuating performance itself,
for reasons not related to the rest of SUT. For example
due to pauses in execution as needed for internal stateful processing.
In many cases this may be an expected per-design behavior,
as it would be observable even in a hypothetical scenario
where all sources of SUT noise are eliminated.
Such behavior affects trial results in a way similar to SUT noise.
As the two phenomenons are hard to distinguish,
in this document the term &#39;noise&#39; is used to encompass
both the internal performance fluctuations of the DUT
and the genuine noise of the SUT.</t>

<t>A simple model of SUT performance consists of an idealized noiseless performance,
and additional noise effects.
For a specific SUT, the noiseless performance is assumed to be constant,
with all observed performance variations being attributed to noise.
The impact of the noise can vary in time, sometimes wildly,
even within a single trial.
The noise can sometimes be negligible, but frequently
it lowers the observed SUT performance as observed in trial results.</t>

<t>In this model, SUT does not have a single performance value, it has a spectrum.
One end of the spectrum is the idealized noiseless performance value,
the other end can be called a noiseful performance.
In practice, trial results close to the noiseful end of the spectrum
happen only rarely.
The worse a possible performance value is, the more rarely it is seen in a trial.
Therefore, the extreme noiseful end of the SUT spectrum is not observable
among trial results.
Furthermore, the extreme noiseless end of the SUT spectrum
is unlikely to be observable, this time because some small noise effects
are very likely to occur multiple times during a trial.</t>

<t>Unless specified otherwise, this document&#39;s focus is
on the potentially observable ends of the SUT performance spectrum,
as opposed to the extreme ones.</t>

<t>When focusing on the DUT, the benchmarking effort should ideally aim
to eliminate only the SUT noise from SUT measurements.
However, this is currently not feasible in practice,
as there are no realistic enough models that would be capable
to distinguish SUT noise from DUT fluctuations
(at least based on authors&#39; experience and available literature).</t>

<t>Assuming a well-constructed SUT, the DUT is likely its primary bottleneck.
In this case, we can define the DUT&#39;s ideal noiseless performance
as the noiseless end of the SUT performance spectrum.
That is true for throughput. Other performance metrics, such as latency,
may require additional considerations.</t>

<t>Note that by this definition, DUT noiseless performance
also minimizes the impact of DUT fluctuations, as much as realistically possible
for a given trial duration.</t>

<t>MLRsearch methodology aims to solve the DUT in SUT problem
by estimating the noiseless end of the SUT performance spectrum
using a limited number of trial results.</t>

<t>Any improvements to the throughput search algorithm, aimed at better
dealing with software networking SUT and DUT setups, should employ
strategies recognizing the presence of SUT noise, allowing the discovery of
(proxies for) DUT noiseless performance
at different levels of sensitivity to SUT noise.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="repeatability-and-comparability"><name>Repeatability and Comparability</name>

<t><xref target="RFC2544"></xref> does not suggest to repeat throughput search.
And from just one discovered throughput value,
it cannot be determined how repeatable that value is.
Poor repeatability then leads to poor comparability,
as different benchmarking teams may obtain varying throughput values
for the same SUT, exceeding the expected differences from search precision.
Repeatability is important also when the test procedure is kept the same,
but SUT is varied in small ways. For example, during development
of software-based DUTs, repeatability is needed to detect small regressions.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC2544"></xref> throughput requirements (60 seconds trial and
no tolerance of a single frame loss) affect the throughput results
in the following way.
The SUT behavior close to the noiseful end of its performance spectrum
consists of rare occasions of significantly low performance,
but the long trial duration makes those occasions not so rare on the trial level.
Therefore, the binary search results tend to wander away from the noiseless end
of SUT performance spectrum, more frequently and more widely than shorter
trials would, thus causing poor throughput repeatability.</t>

<t>The repeatability problem can be addressed by defining a search procedure
that identifies a consistent level of performance,
even if it does not meet the strict definition of throughput in <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>.</t>

<t>According to the SUT performance spectrum model, better repeatability
will be at the noiseless end of the spectrum.
Therefore, solutions to the DUT in SUT problem
will help also with the repeatability problem.</t>

<t>Conversely, any alteration to <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> throughput search
that improves repeatability should be considered
as less dependent on the SUT noise.</t>

<t>An alternative option is to simply run a search multiple times,
and report some statistics (e.g. average and standard deviation).
This can be used for a subset of tests deemed more important,
but it makes the search duration problem even more pronounced.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="throughput-with-non-zero-loss"><name>Throughput with Non-Zero Loss</name>

<t><xref target="RFC1242"></xref> (Section 3.17) defines throughput as:
    The maximum rate at which none of the offered frames
    are dropped by the device.</t>

<t>Then, it says:
    Since even the loss of one frame in a
    data stream can cause significant delays while
    waiting for the higher level protocols to time out,
    it is useful to know the actual maximum data
    rate that the device can support.</t>

<t>However, many benchmarking teams accept a low,
non-zero loss ratio as the goal for their load search.</t>

<t>Motivations are many:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Modern protocols tolerate frame loss better,
compared to the time when <xref target="RFC1242"></xref> and <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> were specified.</t>
  <t>Trials nowadays send way more frames within the same duration,
increasing the chance of a small SUT performance fluctuation
being enough to cause frame loss.</t>
  <t>Small bursts of frame loss caused by noise have otherwise smaller impact
on the average frame loss ratio observed in the trial,
as during other parts of the same trial the SUT may work more closely
to its noiseless performance, thus perhaps lowering the Trial Loss Ratio
below the Goal Loss Ratio value.</t>
  <t>If an approximation of the SUT noise impact on the Trial Loss Ratio is known,
it can be set as the Goal Loss Ratio.</t>
  <t>For more information, see an earlier draft <xref target="Lencze-Shima"></xref> (Section 5)
and references there.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Regardless of the validity of all similar motivations,
support for non-zero loss goals makes any search algorithm more user-friendly.
<xref target="RFC2544"></xref> throughput is not user-friendly in this regard.</t>

<t>Furthermore, allowing users to specify multiple loss ratio values,
and enabling a single search to find all relevant bounds,
significantly enhances the usefulness of the search algorithm.</t>

<t>Searching for multiple Search Goals also helps to describe the SUT performance
spectrum better than the result of a single Search Goal.
For example, the repeated wide gap between zero and non-zero loss loads
indicates the noise has a large impact on the observed performance,
which is not evident from a single goal load search procedure result.</t>

<t>It is easy to modify the vanilla bisection to find a lower bound
for the load that satisfies a non-zero Goal Loss Ratio.
But it is not that obvious how to search for multiple goals at once,
hence the support for multiple Search Goals remains a problem.</t>

<t>There does not seem to be a consensus on which ratio value is the best.
For users, performance of higher protocol layers is important, for
example goodput of TCP connection (TCP throughput), but relationship
between goodput and loss ratio is not simple. See
<xref target="Lencze-Kovacs-Shima"></xref> for examples of various corner cases,
<xref target="RFC6349"></xref> Section 3 for loss ratios acceptable for an accurate
measurement of TCP throughput, and <xref target="Ott-Mathis-Semke-Mahdavi"></xref> for
models and calculations of TCP performance in presence of packet loss.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="inconsistent-trial-results"><name>Inconsistent Trial Results</name>

<t>While performing throughput search by executing a sequence of
measurement trials, there is a risk of encountering inconsistencies
between trial results.</t>

<t>Examples include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A trial at the same load (same or different trial duration) results
in a different Trial Loss Ratio.</t>
  <t>A trial at a larger load (same or different trial duration) results
in a lower Trial Loss Ratio.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The plain bisection never encounters inconsistent trials.
But <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> hints about the possibility of inconsistent trial results,
in two places in its text.
The first place is Section 24, where full trial durations are required,
presumably because they can be inconsistent with the results
from short trial durations.
The second place is Section 26.3, where two successive zero-loss trials
are recommended, presumably because after one zero-loss trial
there can be a subsequent inconsistent non-zero-loss trial.</t>

<t>Any robust throughput search algorithm needs to decide how to continue
the search in the presence of such inconsistencies.
Definitions of throughput in <xref target="RFC1242"></xref> and <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> are not specific enough
to imply a unique way of handling such inconsistencies.</t>

<t>Ideally, there will be a definition of a new quantity which both generalizes
throughput for non-zero Goal Loss Ratio values
(and other possible repeatability enhancements), while being precise enough
to force a specific way to resolve trial result inconsistencies.
But until such a definition is agreed upon, the correct way to handle
inconsistent trial results remains an open problem.</t>

<t>Relevant Lower Bound is the MLRsearch term that addresses this problem.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="mlrsearch-specification"><name>MLRsearch Specification</name>

<t>MLRsearch specification describes all technical
definitions needed for evaluating whether a particular test procedure
complies with MLRsearch specification.</t>

<t>Some terms used in the specification are capitalized.
It is just a stylistic choice for this document,
reminding the reader this term is introduced, defined or explained
elsewhere in the document. See <xref target="index">Index </xref> for list of such terms.
Lowercase variants are equally valid.</t>

<t>Each per term subsection contains a short <strong>Definition</strong> paragraph
containing a minimal definition and all strict requirements,
followed by <strong>Discussion</strong> paragraphs focusing on
important consequences and recommendations.
Requirements on the way other components can use the defined quantity
are also present in the discussion paragraphs.</t>

<t>Other text in this section discusses document structure
and non-authoritative summaries.</t>

<section anchor="overview"><name>Overview</name>

<t>MLRsearch Specification describes a set of abstract system components,
acting as functions with specified inputs and outputs.</t>

<t>A test procedure is said to comply with MLRsearch Specification
if it can be conceptually divided into analogous components,
each satisfying requirements for the corresponding MLRsearch component.
Any such compliant test procedure is called a MLRsearch Implementation.</t>

<t>The Measurer component is tasked to perform Trials,
the Controller component is tasked to select Trial Durations and Loads,
the Manager component is tasked to pre-configure everything
and to produce the test report.
The test report explicitly states Search Goals (as Controller inputs)
and corresponding Goal Results (Controller outputs).</t>

<t>The Manager calls the Controller once,
the Controller keeps calling the Measurer
until all stopping conditions are met.</t>

<t>The part where Controller calls the Measurer is called the Search.
Any activity done by the Manager before it calls the Controller
(or after Controller returns) is not considered to be part of the Search.</t>

<t>MLRsearch Specification prescribes regular search results and recommends
their stopping conditions. Irregular search results are also allowed,
they may have different requirements and stopping conditions.</t>

<t>Search results are based on Load Classification.
When measured enough, any chosen Load can either achieve or fail
each Search Goal (separately), thus becoming
a Lower Bound or an Upper Bound for that Search Goal, respectively.</t>

<t>For repeatability and comparability reasons, it is important that
all implementations of MLRsearch classify the Load equivalently,
based on all Trials measured at that Load.</t>

<t>When the Relevant Lower Bound is close enough to Relevant Upper Bound
according to Goal Width, the Regular Goal Result is found.
Search stops when all Regular Goal Results are found,
or when some Search Goals are proven to have only Irregular Goal Results.</t>

<section anchor="behavior-correctness"><name>Behavior Correctness</name>

<t>MLRsearch Specification by itself does not guarantee
the Search ends in finite time, as the freedom the Controller has
for Load selection also allows for clearly deficient choices.</t>

<t>Although the authors believe that any MLRsearch Implementation
that aims to shorten the Search Duration (with fixed Controller Input)
will necessarily also become good at repeatability and comparability,
any attempts to prove such claims are outside of the scope of this document.</t>

<t>For deeper insights, see <xref target="FDio-CSIT-MLRsearch"></xref>.</t>

<t>The primary MLRsearch Implementation, used as the prototype
for this specification, is <xref target="PyPI-MLRsearch"></xref>.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="quantities"><name>Quantities</name>

<t>MLRsearch specification uses a number of specific quantities,
some of them can be expressed in several different units.</t>

<t>In general, MLRsearch specification does not require particular units to be used,
but it is REQUIRED for the test report to state all the units.
For example, ratio quantities can be dimensionless numbers between zero and one,
but may be expressed as percentages instead.</t>

<t>For convenience, a group of quantities can be treated as a composite quantity,
One constituent of a composite quantity is called an attribute,
and a group of attribute values is called an instance of that composite quantity.</t>

<t>Some attributes are not independent from others,
and they can be calculated from other attributes.
Such quantites are called derived quantities.</t>

<section anchor="current-and-final-values"><name>Current and Final Values</name>

<t>Some quantites are defined in a way that allows computing their values
in the middle of the Search. Other quantities are specified in a way
that allows their values to be computed only after the Search ends.
And some quantities are important only after the Search ended,
but their values are computable also before the Search ends.</t>

<t>For a quantity that is computable before the Search ends,
the adjective <strong>current</strong> is used to mark a value of that quantity
available before the Search ends.
When such value is relevant for the search result, the adjective <strong>final</strong>
is used to denote the value of that quantity at the end of the Search.</t>

<t>If a time evolution of such a dynamic quantity is guided
by configuration quantities, those adjectives can be used
to distinguish quantities.
For example if the current value of &quot;duration&quot; (dynamic quantity) increases
from &quot;initial duration&quot; to &quot;final duration&quot; (configuration quantities),
all the quoted names denote separate but related quantites.
As the naming suggests, the final value od &quot;duration&quot; is expected
to be equal to &quot;final duration&quot; value.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="existing-terms"><name>Existing Terms</name>

<t>This specification relies on the following three documents that should
be consulted before attempting to make use of this document:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>RFC 1242 &quot;Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect Devices&quot;
contains basic term definitions.</t>
  <t>RFC 2285 &quot;Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices&quot; adds
more terms and discussions, describing some known network
benchmarking situations in a more precise way.</t>
  <t>RFC 2544 &quot;Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices&quot;
contains discussions of a number of terms and additional methodology
requirements.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Definitions of some central terms from above documents are copied and
discussed in the following subsections.</t>

<section anchor="sut"><name>SUT</name>

<t>Defined in <xref target="RFC2285"></xref> (Section 3.1.2) as follows.</t>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>The collective set of network devices to which stimulus is offered
as a single entity and response measured.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>An SUT consisting of a single network device is also allowed.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="dut"><name>DUT</name>

<t>Defined in <xref target="RFC2285"></xref> (Section 3.1.1) as follows.</t>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>The network forwarding device to which stimulus is offered and
response measured.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>DUT, as a sub-component of SUT, is only indirectly mentioned
in MLRsearch specification, but is of key relevance for its motivation.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="trial"><name>Trial</name>

<t>A trial is the part of the test described in <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section 23).</t>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>A particular test consists of multiple trials.  Each trial returns
   one piece of information, for example the loss rate at a particular
   input frame rate.  Each trial consists of a number of phases:</t>

<t>a) If the DUT is a router, send the routing update to the &quot;input&quot;
   port and pause two seconds to be sure that the routing has settled.</t>

<t>b)  Send the &quot;learning frames&quot; to the &quot;output&quot; port and wait 2
   seconds to be sure that the learning has settled.  Bridge learning
   frames are frames with source addresses that are the same as the
   destination addresses used by the test frames.  Learning frames for
   other protocols are used to prime the address resolution tables in
   the DUT.  The formats of the learning frame that should be used are
   shown in the Test Frame Formats document.</t>

<t>c) Run the test trial.</t>

<t>d) Wait for two seconds for any residual frames to be received.</t>

<t>e) Wait for at least five seconds for the DUT to restabilize.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>The traffic is sent only in phase c) and received in phases c) and d).</t>

<t>The definition describes some traits, and it is not clear whether all of them
are required, or some of them are only recommended.</t>

<t>Trials are the only stimuli the SUT is expected to experience during the Search.</t>

<t>For the purposes of the MLRsearch specification,
it is ALLOWED for the test procedure to deviate from the <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> description,
but any such deviation MUST be described explicitly in the test report.</t>

<t>In some discussion paragraphs, it is useful to consider the traffic
as sent and received by a tester, as implicitly defined
in <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section 6).</t>

<t>An example of deviation from <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> is using shorter wait times,
compared to those described in phases a), b), d) and e).</t>

<t>The <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> document itself seems to be treating phase b)
as any type of configuration that cannot be configured only once (by Manager,
before Search starts), as some crucial SUT state could time-out during the Search.
This document RECOMMENDS to understand &quot;learning frames&quot; to be
any such time-sensitive per-trial configuration method,
with bridge MAC learning being only one possibe example.
<xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section C.2.4.1) lists another example: ARP with wait time 5 seconds.</t>

<t>Trial Duration is the intended duration of the phase c) of a Trial.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>While any positive real value may be provided, some Measurer implementations
MAY limit possible values, e.g. by rounding down to nearest integer in seconds.
In that case, it is RECOMMENDED to give such inputs to the Controller
so the Controller only proposes the accepted values.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="trial-load"><name>Trial Load</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>Trial Load is the per-interface Intended Load for a Trial.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>For test report purposes, it is assumed that this is a constant load by default,
as specified in <xref target="RFC1242"></xref> (Section 3.4).</t>

<t>Trial Load MAY be only an average load,
e.g. when the traffic is intended to be bursty,
e.g. as suggested in <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section 21).
In the case of non-constant load, the test report
MUST explicitly mention how exactly non-constant the traffic is.</t>

<t>Trial Load is equivalent to the quantities defined
as constant load of <xref target="RFC1242"></xref> (Section 3.4),
data rate of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section 14),
and Intended Load of <xref target="RFC2285"></xref> (Section 3.5.1),
in the sense that all three definitions specify that this value
applies to one (input or output) interface.</t>

<t>Similarly to Trial Duration, some Measurers may limit the possible values
of trial load. Contrary to trial duration, the test report is not REQUIRED
to document such behavior, as in practice the load differences
are negligible (and frequently undocumented).</t>

<t>It is ALLOWED to combine Trial Load and Trial Duration values in a way
that would not be possible to achieve using any integer number of data frames.</t>

<t>If a particular Trial Load value is not tied to a single Trial,
e.g. if there are no Trials yet or if there are multiple Trials,
this document uses a shorthand <strong>Load</strong>.</t>

<t>For test report purposes, multi-interface aggregate load MAY be reported,
and is understood as the same quantity expressed using different units.
From the report it MUST be clear whether a particular Trial Load value
is per one interface, or an aggregate over all interfaces.
This implies there is a known and constant coefficient between
single-interface and multi-interface load values.
The single-interface value is still the primary one,
as most other documents deal with single-interface quantites only.</t>

<t>The last paragraph also applies to other terms related to Load.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="trial-input"><name>Trial Input</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>Trial Input is a composite quantity, consisting of two attributes:
Trial Duration and Trial Load.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>When talking about multiple Trials, it is common to say &quot;Trial Inputs&quot;
to denote all corresponding Trial Input instances.</t>

<t>A Trial Input instance acts as the input for one call of the Measurer component.</t>

<t>Contrary to other composite quantities, MLRsearch Implementations
are NOT ALLOWED to add optional attributes here.
This improves interoperability between various implementations of
the Controller and the Measurer.</t>

<t>Please note that both attributes are <strong>intended</strong> quantities,
as only those can be fully controlled by the Controller.
The actual offered quantities, as realized by the Measurer, can be different
(and must be different if not multiplying into integer number of frames),
but questions around those offered quantities are generally
outside of the scope of this document.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="traffic-profile"><name>Traffic Profile</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>Traffic Profile is a composite quantity containing
all attributes other than Trial Load and Trial Duration,
that are needed for unique determination of the Trial to be performed.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>All the attributes are assumed to be constant during the search,
and the composite is configured on the Measurer by the Manager
before the Search starts.
This is why the traffic profile is not part of the Trial Input.</t>

<t>As a consequence, implementations of the Manager and the Measurer
must be aware of their common set of capabilities, so that Traffic Profile
instance uniquely defines the traffic during the Search.
The important fact is that none of those capabilities
have to be known by the Controller implementations.</t>

<t>The Traffic Profile SHOULD contain some specific quantities defined elsewhere.
For example <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section 9) governs
data link frame sizes as defined in <xref target="RFC1242"></xref> (Section 3.5).</t>

<t>Several more specific quantities may be RECOMMENDED, depending on media type.
For example, <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Appendix C) lists frame formats and protocol addresses,
as recommended in <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section 8) and <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section 12).</t>

<t>Depending on SUT configuration, e.g. when testing specific protocols,
additional attributes MUST be included in the traffic profile
and in the test report.</t>

<t>Example: <xref target="RFC8219"></xref> (Section 5.3) introduces traffic setups
consisting of a mix of IPv4 and IPv6 traffic - the implied traffic profile
therefore must include an attribute for their percentage.</t>

<t>Other traffic properties that need to be somehow specified in Traffic
Profile, if they apply to the test scenario, include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>bidirectional traffic from <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section 14),</t>
  <t>fully meshed traffic from <xref target="RFC2285"></xref> (Section 3.3.3),</t>
  <t>modifiers from <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section 11).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="trial-forwarding-ratio"><name>Trial Forwarding Ratio</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>The Trial Forwarding Ratio is a dimensionless floating point value.
It MUST range between 0.0 and 1.0, both inclusive.
It is calculated by dividing the number of frames
successfully forwarded by the SUT
by the total number of frames expected to be forwarded during the trial.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>For most Traffic Profiles, &quot;expected to be forwarded&quot; means
&quot;intended to get transmitted from tester towards SUT&quot;.
Only if this is not the case, the test report MUST describe the Traffic Profile
in a way that implies how Trial Forwarding Ratio should be calculated.</t>

<t>Trial Forwarding Ratio MAY be expressed in other units
(e.g. as a percentage) in the test report.</t>

<t>Note that, contrary to Load terms, frame counts used to compute
Trial Forwarding Ratio are generally aggregates over all SUT output interfaces,
as most test procedures verify all outgoung frames.</t>

<t>For example, in a test with symmetric bidirectional traffic,
if one direction is forwarded without losses, but the opposite direction
does not forward at all, the trial forwarding ratio would be 0.5 (50%).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="trial-loss-ratio"><name>Trial Loss Ratio</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>The Trial Loss Ratio is equal to one minus the Trial Forwarding Ratio.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>100% minus the Trial Forwarding Ratio, when expressed as a percentage.</t>

<t>This is almost identical to Frame Loss Rate of <xref target="RFC1242"></xref> (Section 3.6).
The only minor differences are that Trial Loss Ratio
does not need to be expressed as a percentage,
and Trial Loss Ratio is explicitly based on aggregate frame counts.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="trial-forwarding-rate"><name>Trial Forwarding Rate</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>The Trial Forwarding Rate is a derived quantity, calculated by
multiplying the Trial Load by the Trial Forwarding Ratio.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>It is important to note that while similar, this quantity is not identical
to the Forwarding Rate as defined in <xref target="RFC2285"></xref> (Section 3.6.1).
The latter is based on frame counts on one output interface only,
so each output interface can have different forwarding rate,
whereas the Trial Forwarding Rate is based on frame counts
aggregated over all SUT output interfaces, while stil being a multiple of Load.</t>

<t>Consequently, for symmetric bidirectional Traffic Profiles,
the Trial Forwarding Rate value is equal to arithmetic average
of <xref target="RFC2285"></xref> Forwarding Rate values across both output interfaces.</t>

<t>Given that Trial Forwarding Rate is a quantity based on Load,
it is ALLOWED to express this quantity using multi-interface values
in test report, e.g. as sum of per-interface forwarding rate values.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="trial-effective-duration"><name>Trial Effective Duration</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>Trial Effective Duration is a time quantity related to the trial,
by default equal to the Trial Duration.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>This is an optional feature.
If the Measurer does not return any Trial Effective Duration value,
the Controller MUST use the Trial Duration value instead.</t>

<t>Trial Effective Duration may be any time quantity chosen by the Measurer
to be used for time-based decisions in the Controller.</t>

<t>The test report MUST explain how the Measurer computes the returned
Trial Effective Duration values, if they are not always
equal to the Trial Duration.</t>

<t>This feature can be beneficial for users
who wish to manage the overall search duration,
rather than solely the traffic portion of it.
Simply measure the duration of the whole trial (including all wait times)
and use that as the Trial Effective Duration.</t>

<t>This is also a way for the Measurer to inform the Controller about
its surprising behavior, for example when rounding the Trial Duration value.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="trial-output"><name>Trial Output</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>Trial Output is a composite quantity. The REQUIRED attributes are
Trial Loss Ratio, Trial Effective Duration and Trial Forwarding Rate.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>When talking about multiple trials, it is common to say &quot;Trial Outputs&quot;
to denote all corresponding Trial Output instances.</t>

<t>Implementations may provide additional (optional) attributes.
The Controller implementations MUST ignore values of any optional attribute
they are not familiar with,
except when passing Trial Output instances to the Manager.</t>

<t>Example of an optional attribute:
The aggregate number of frames expected to be forwarded during the trial,
especially if it is not just (a rounded-down value)
implied by Trial Load and Trial Duration.</t>

<t>While <xref target="RFC2285"></xref> (Section 3.5.2) requires the Offered Load value
to be reported for forwarding rate measurements,
it is not REQUIRED in MLRsearch Specification,
as search results do not depend on it.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="trial-result"><name>Trial Result</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>Trial Result is a composite quantity,
consisting of the Trial Input and the Trial Output.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>When talking about multiple trials, it is common to say &quot;Trial Results&quot;
to denote all corresponding Trial Result instances.</t>

<t>While implementations SHOULD NOT include additional attributes
with independent values, they MAY include derived quantities.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="goal-terms"><name>Goal Terms</name>

<t>This section defines new terms for quantities relevant (directly or indirectly)
for inputs and outputs of the Controller component.</t>

<t>Several goal attributes are defined before introducing
the main composite quantity: the Search Goal.</t>

<t>Contrary to other sections, definitions in subsections of this section
are necessarily vague, as their fundamental meaning is to act as
coefficients in formulas for Controller Output, which are not defined yet.</t>

<t>The discussions here relate the attributes to concepts mentioned in chapter
<xref target="identified-problems">Identified Problems</xref>, but even these discussion
paragraphs are short, informal, and mostly referencing later sections,
where the impact on search results is discussed after introducing
the complete set of auxiliary terms.</t>

<section anchor="goal-final-trial-duration"><name>Goal Final Trial Duration</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>Minimal value for Trial Duration that has to be reached.
The value MUST be positive.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>Some Trials have to be at least this long
to allow a Load to be classified as a Lower Bound.
The Controller is allowed to choose shorter durations,
results of those may be enough for classification as an Upper Bound.</t>

<t>It is RECOMMENDED for all search goals to share the same
Goal Final Trial Duration value. Otherwise, Trial Duration values larger than
the Goal Final Trial Duration may occur, weakening the assumptions
the <xref target="load-classification-logic">Load Classification Logic</xref> is based on.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="goal-duration-sum"><name>Goal Duration Sum</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>A threshold value for a particular sum of Trial Effective Duration values.
The value MUST be positive.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>Informally, this prescribes the sufficient amount of trials performed
at a specific Trial Load and Goal Final Trial Duration during the search.</t>

<t>If the Goal Duration Sum is larger than the Goal Final Trial Duration,
multiple trials may be needed to be performed at the same load.</t>

<t>See section <xref target="mlrsearch-compliant-with-tst009">MLRsearch Compliant with TST009</xref>
of this document for an example where the possibility of multiple trials
at the same load is intended.</t>

<t>A Goal Duration Sum value shorter than the Goal Final Trial Duration
(of the same goal) could save some search time, but is NOT RECOMMENDED,
as the time savings come at the cost of decreased repeatability.</t>

<t>In practice, the Search can spend less than Goal Duration Sum measuring
a Load value when the results are particularly one-sided,
but also the Search can spend more than Goal Duration Sum measuring a Load
when the results are balanced and include
trials shorter than Goal Final Trial Duration.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="goal-loss-ratio"><name>Goal Loss Ratio</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>A threshold value for Trial Loss Ratio values.
The value MUST be non-negative and smaller than one.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>A trial with Trial Loss Ratio larger than this value
signals the SUT may be unable to process this Trial Load well enough.</t>

<t>See <xref target="throughput-with-non-zero-loss">Throughput with Non-Zero Loss</xref>
for reasons why users may want to set this value above zero.</t>

<t>Since multiple trials may be needed for one Load value,
the Load Classification is generally more complicated than mere comparison
of Trial Loss Ratio to Goal Loss Ratio.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="goal-exceed-ratio"><name>Goal Exceed Ratio</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>A threshold value for a particular ratio of sums
of Trial Effective Duration values.
The value MUST be non-negative and smaller than one.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>Informally, up to this proportion of Trial Results
with Trial Loss Ratio above Goal Loss Ratio is tolerated at a Lower Bound.
This is the full impact if every Trial was measured at Goal Final Trial Duration.
The actual full logic is more complicated, as shorter Trials are allowed.</t>

<t>For explainability reasons, the RECOMMENDED value for exceed ratio is 0.5 (50%),
as in practice that value leads to
the smallest variation in overall Search Duration.</t>

<t>See <xref target="exceed-ratio-and-multiple-trials">Exceed Ratio and Multiple Trials</xref>
section for more details.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="goal-width"><name>Goal Width</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>A threshold value for deciding whether two Trial Load values are close enough.
This is an OPTIONAL attribute. If present, the value MUST be positive.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>Informally, this acts as a stopping condition,
controlling the precision of the search result.
The search stops if every goal has reached its precision.</t>

<t>Implementations without this attribute
MUST give the Controller other ways to control the search stopping conditions.</t>

<t>Absolute load difference and relative load difference are two popular choices,
but implementations may choose a different way to specify width.</t>

<t>The test report MUST make it clear what specific quantity is used as Goal Width.</t>

<t>It is RECOMMENDED to set the Goal Width (as relative difference) value
to a value no lower than the Goal Loss Ratio.
If the reason is not obvious, see the details in
<xref target="generalized-throughput">Generalized Throughput</xref>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="goal-initial-trial-duration"><name>Goal Initial Trial Duration</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>Minimal value for Trial Duration suggested to use for this goal.
If present, this value MUST be positive.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>This is an example of an OPTIONAL Search Goal some implementations may support.</t>

<t>The reasonable default value is equal to the Goal Final Trial Duration value.</t>

<t>Informally, this is the shortest Trial Duration the Controller should select
when focusing on the goal.</t>

<t>Note that shorter Trial Duration values can still be used,
for example selected while focusing on a different Search Goal.
Such results MUST be still accepted by the Load Classification logic.</t>

<t>Goal Initial Trial Duration is just a way for the user to discourage
trials with Trial Duration values deemed as too unreliable
for particular SUT and this Search Goal.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="search-goal"><name>Search Goal</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>The Search Goal is a composite quantity consisting of several attributes,
some of them are required.</t>

<t>Required attributes:
- Goal Final Trial Duration
- Goal Duration Sum
- Goal Loss Ratio
- Goal Exceed Ratio</t>

<t>Optional attributes:
- Goal Initial Trial Duration
- Goal Width</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>Implementations MAY add their own attributes.
Those additional attributes may be required by the implementation
even if they are not required by MLRsearch specification.
But it is RECOMMENDED for those implementations
to support missing attributes by providing reasonable default values.</t>

<t>For example, implementations with Goal Initial Trial Durations
may also require users to specify &quot;how quickly&quot; should Trial Durations increase.</t>

<t>See <xref target="compliance">Compliance </xref> for important Search Goal instances.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="controller-input"><name>Controller Input</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>Controller Input is a composite quantity
required as an input for the Controller.
The only REQUIRED attribute is a list of Search Goal instances.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>MLRsearch Implementations MAY use additional attributes.
Those additional attributes may be required by the implementation
even if they are not required by MLRsearch specification.</t>

<t>Formally, the Manager does not apply any Controller configuration
apart from one Controller Input instance.</t>

<t>For example, Traffic Profile is configured on the Measurer by the Manager,
without explicit assistance of the Controller.</t>

<t>The order of Search Goal instances in a list SHOULD NOT
have a big impact on Controller Output,
but MLRsearch Implementations MAY base their behavior on the order
of Search Goal instances in a list.</t>

<section anchor="max-load"><name>Max Load</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>Max Load is an optional attribute of Controller Input.
It is the maximal value the Controller is allowed to use for Trial Load values.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>Max Load is an example of an optional attribute (outside the list of Search Goals)
required by some implementations of MLRsearch.</t>

<t>In theory, each search goal could have its own Max Load value,
but as all Trial Results are possibly affecting all Search Goals,
it makes more sense for a single Max Load value to apply
to all Search Goal instances.</t>

<t>While Max Load is a frequently used configuration parameter, already governed
(as maximum frame rate) by <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section 20)
and (as maximum offered load) by <xref target="RFC2285"></xref> (Section 3.5.3),
some implementations may detect or discover it
(instead of requiring a user-supplied value).</t>

<t>In MLRsearch specification, one reason for listing
the <xref target="relevant-upper-bound">Relevant Upper Bound</xref> as a required attribute
is that it makes the search result independent of Max Load value.</t>

<t>Given that Max Load is a quantity based on Load,
it is ALLOWED to express this quantity using multi-interface values
in test report, e.g. as sum of per-interface maximal loads.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="min-load"><name>Min Load</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>Min Load is an optional attribute of Controller Input.
It is the minimal value the Controller is allowed to use for Trial Load values.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>Min Load is another example of an optional attribute
required by some implementations of MLRsearch.
Similarly to Max Load, it makes more sense to prescribe one common value,
as opposed to using a different value for each Search Goal.</t>

<t>Min Load is mainly useful for saving time by failing early,
arriving at an Irregular Goal Result when Min Load gets classified
as an Upper Bound.</t>

<t>For implementations, it is RECOMMENDED to require Min Load to be non-zero
and large enough to result in at least one frame being forwarded
even at shortest allowed Trial Duration,
so that Trial Loss Ratio is always well-defined,
and the implementation can apply relative Goal Width safely.</t>

<t>Given that Min Load is a quantity based on Load,
it is ALLOWED to express this quantity using multi-interface values
in test report, e.g. as sum of per-interface minimal loads.</t>

<section anchor="auxiliary-terms"><name>Auxiliary Terms</name>

<t>While the terms defined in this section are not strictly needed
when formulating MLRsearch requirements, they simplify the language used
in discussion paragraphs and explanation chapters.</t>

<section anchor="trial-classification"><name>Trial Classification</name>

<t>When one Trial Result instance is compared to one Search Goal instance,
several relations can be named using short adjectives.</t>

<t>As trial results do not affect each other, this <strong>Trial Classification</strong>
does not change during the Search.</t>

<section anchor="high-loss-trial"><name>High-Loss Trial</name>

<t>A trial with Trial Loss Ratio larger than a Goal Loss Ratio value
is called a <strong>high-loss trial</strong>, with respect to given Search Goal
(or lossy trial, if Goal Loss Ratio is zero).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="low-loss-trial"><name>Low-Loss Trial</name>

<t>If a trial is not high-loss, it is called a <strong>low-loss trial</strong>
(or zero-loss trial, if Goal Loss Ratio is zero).</t>

<section anchor="long-trial"><name>Long Trial</name>

<t>A trial with Trial Duration longer than the Goal Final Trial Duration
is called a <strong>long trial</strong>.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="load-classification"><name>Load Classification</name>

<t>When a set of all Trial Result instances, performed so far
at one Trial Load, is compared to one Search Goal instance,
their relation can be named using the concept of a bound.</t>

<t>In general, such bounds are a current quantity,
even though cases of a Load changing its classification more than once
during the Search is rare in practice.</t>

<section anchor="upper-bound"><name>Upper Bound</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>A Load value is called an Upper Bound if and only if it is classified
as such by <xref target="appendix-a-load-classification">Appendix A: Load Classification</xref>
algorithm for the given Search Goal at the current moment of the Search.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>In more detail, the set of all Trial Results
performed so far at the Trial Load (and any Trial Duration)
is certain to fail to uphold all the requirements of the given Search Goal,
mainly the Goal Loss Ratio in combination with the Goal Exceed Ratio.
Here &quot;certain to fail&quot; relates to any possible results within the time
remaining till Goal Duration Sum.</t>

<t>One search goal can have multiple different Trial Load values
classified as its Upper Bounds.
While search progresses and more trials are measured,
any load value can become an Upper Bound in principle.</t>

<t>Moreover, a load can stop being an Upper Bound, but that
can only happen when more than Goal Duration Sum of trials are measured
(e.g. because another Search Goal needs more trials at this load).
In practice, the load becomes a Lower Bound (see next subsection),
and we say the previous Upper Bound got Invalidated.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="lower-bound"><name>Lower Bound</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>A Load value is called a Lower Bound if and only if it is classified
as such by <xref target="appendix-a-load-classification">Appendix A: Load Classification</xref>
algorithm for the given Search Goal at the current moment of the search.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>In more detail, the set of all Trial Results
performed so far at the Trial Load (and any Trial Duration)
is certain to uphold all the requirements of the given Search Goal,
mainly the Goal Loss Ratio in combination with the Goal Exceed Ratio.
Here &quot;certain to uphold&quot; relates to any possible results within the time
remaining till Goal Duration Sum.</t>

<t>One search goal can have multiple different Trial Load values
classified as its Lower Bounds.
As search progresses and more trials are measured,
any load value can become a Lower Bound in principle.</t>

<t>No load can be both an Upper Bound and a Lower Bound for the same Search goal
at the same time, but it is possible for a larger load to be a Lower Bound
while a smaller load is an Upper Bound.</t>

<t>Moreover, a load can stop being a Lower Bound, but that
can only happen when more than Goal Duration Sum of trials are measured
(e.g. because another Search Goal needs more trials at this load).
In that case, the load becomes an Upper Bound,
and we say the previous Lower Bound got Invalidated.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="undecided"><name>Undecided</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>A Load value is called Undecided if it is currently
neither an Upper Bound nor a Lower Bound.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>A Load value that has not been measured so far is Undecided.</t>

<t>It is possible for a Load to transition from an Upper Bound to Undecided
by adding Short Trials with Low-Loss results.
That is yet another reason for users to avoid using Search Goal instances
with diferent Goal Final Trial Duration values.</t>

<section anchor="result-terms"><name>Result Terms</name>

<t>Before defining the full structure of Controller Output,
it is useful to define the composite quantity called Goal Result.
The following subsections define its attribute first,
before describing the Goal Result quantity.</t>

<t>There is a correspondence between Search Goals and Goal Results.
Most of the following subsections refer to a given Search Goal,
when defining their terms.
Conversely, at the end of the search, each Search Goal instance
has its corresponding Goal Result instance.</t>

<section anchor="relevant-upper-bound"><name>Relevant Upper Bound</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>The Relevant Upper Bound is the smallest Trial Load value
classified as an Upper Bound for a given Search Goal at the end of the Search.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>If no measured load had enough High-Loss Trials,
the Relevant Upper Bound MAY be non-existent.
For example, when Max Load is classified as a Lower Bound.</t>

<t>Conversely, when Relevant Upper Bound does exist,
it is not affected by Max Load value.</t>

<t>Given that Relevant Upper Bound is a quantity based on Load,
it is ALLOWED to express this quantity using multi-interface values
in test report, e.g. as sum of per-interface loads.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="relevant-lower-bound"><name>Relevant Lower Bound</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>The Relevant Lower Bound is the largest Trial Load value
among those smaller than the Relevant Upper Bound, that got classified
as a Lower Bound for a given Search Goal at the end of the search.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>If no load had enough Low-Loss Trials, the Relevant Lower Bound
MAY be non-existent.</t>

<t>Strictly speaking, if the Relevant Upper Bound does not exist,
the Relevant Lower Bound also does not exist.
In a typical case, Max Load is classified as a Lower Bound,
making it impossible to increase the Load to continue the search
for an Upper Bound.
Thus, it is not clear whether a larger value would be found
for a Relevant Lower Bound if larger Loads were possible.</t>

<t>Given that Relevant Lower Bound is a quantity based on Load,
it is ALLOWED to express this quantity using multi-interface values
in test report, e.g. as sum of per-interface loads.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="conditional-throughput"><name>Conditional Throughput</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>Conditional Throughput is a value computed at the Relevant Lower Bound
according to algorithm defined in
<xref target="appendix-b-conditional-throughput">Appendix B: Conditional Throughput</xref>.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>The Relevant Lower Bound is defined only at the end of the Search,
and so is the Conditional Throughput.
But the algorithm can be applied at any time on any Lower Bound load,
so the final Conditional Throughput value may appear sooner
than at the end of the Search.</t>

<t>Informally, the Conditional Throughput should be
a typical Trial Forwarding Rate, expected to be seen
at the Relevant Lower Bound of the given Search Goal.</t>

<t>But frequently it is only a conservative estimate thereof,
as MLRsearch Implementations tend to stop measuring more Trials
as soon as they confirm the value cannot get worse than this estimate
within the Goal Duration Sum.</t>

<t>This value is RECOMMENDED to be used when evaluating repeatability
and comparability of different MLRsearch Implementations.</t>

<t>See <xref target="generalized-throughput">Generalized Throughput</xref> for more details.</t>

<t>Given that Conditional Throughput is a quantity based on Load,
it is ALLOWED to express this quantity using multi-interface values
in test report, e.g. as sum of per-interface foerwarding rates.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="goal-results"><name>Goal Results</name>

<t>MLRsearch specification is based on a set of requirements
for a &quot;regular&quot; result. But in practice, it is not always possible
for such result instance to exist, so also &quot;irregular&quot; results
need to be supported.</t>

<section anchor="regular-goal-result"><name>Regular Goal Result</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>Regular Goal Result is a composite quantity consisting of several attributes.
Relevant Upper Bound and Relevant Lower Bound are REQUIRED attributes,
Conditional Throughput is a RECOMMENDED attribute.
Stopping conditions for the corresponding Search Goal MUST be satisfied.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>Both relevant bounds MUST exist.</t>

<t>If the implementation offers Goal Width as a Search Goal attribute,
the distance between the Relevant Lower Bound
and the Relevant Upper Bound MUST NOT be larger than the Goal Width,</t>

<t>Implementations MAY add their own attributes.</t>

<t>Test report MUST display Relevant Lower Bound.
Displaying Relevant Upper Bound is not REQUIRED, but it is RECOMMENDED,
especially if the implementation does not use Goal Width.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="irregular-goal-result"><name>Irregular Goal Result</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>Irregular Goal Result is a composite quantity. No attributes are required.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>It is RECOMMENDED to report any useful quantity even if it does not
satisfy all the requirements. For example if Max Load is classified
as a Lower Bound, it is fine to report it as an &quot;effective&quot; Relevant Lower Bound
(although not a real one, as that requires
Relevant Upper Bound which does not exist in this case),
and compute Conditional Throughput for it. In this case,
only the missing Relevant Upper Bound signals this result instance is irregular.</t>

<t>Similarly, if both revevant bounds exist, it is RECOMMENDED
to include them as Irregular Goal Result attributes,
and let the Manager decide if their distance is too far for users&#39; purposes.</t>

<t>If test report displays some Irregular Goal Result attribute values,
they MUST be clearly marked as comming from irregular results.</t>

<t>The implementation MAY define additional attributes.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="goal-result"><name>Goal Result</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>Goal Result is a composite quantity.
Each instance is either a Regular Goal Result or an Irregular Goal Result.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>The Manager MUST be able to distinguish whether the instance is regular or not.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="search-result"><name>Search Result</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>The Search Result is a single composite object
that maps each Search Goal instance to a corresponding Goal Result instance.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>Alternatively, the Search Result can be implemented as an ordered list
of the Goal Result instances, matching the order of Search Goal instances.</t>

<t>The Search Result (as a mapping)
MUST map from all the Search Goal instances present in the Controller Input.</t>

<t>Identical Goal Result instances MAY be listed for different Search Goals,
but their status as regular or irregular may be different.
For example if two goals differ only in Goal Width value,
and the relevant bound values are close enough according to only one of them.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="controller-output"><name>Controller Output</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>The Controller Output is a composite quantity returned from the Controller
to the Manager at the end of the search.
The Search Result instance is its only REQUIRED attribute.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>MLRsearch Implementation MAY return additional data in the Controller Output,
for example number of trials performed and the total Search Duration.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="mlrsearch-architecture"><name>MLRsearch Architecture</name>

<t>MLRsearch architecture consists of three main system components:
the Manager, the Controller, and the Measurer.</t>

<t>The architecture also implies the presence of other components,
such as the SUT and the tester (as a sub-component of the Measurer).</t>

<t>Protocols of communication between components are generally left unspecified.
For example, when MLRsearch specification mentions &quot;Controller calls Measurer&quot;,
it is possible that the Controller notifies the Manager
to call the Measurer indirectly instead. This way the Measurer Implementations
can be fully independent from the Controller implementations,
e.g. developed in different programming languages.</t>

<section anchor="measurer"><name>Measurer</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>The Measurer is an abstract system component that when called
with a <xref target="trial-input">Trial Input</xref> instance, performs one <xref target="trial">Trial </xref>,
and returns a <xref target="trial-output">Trial Output</xref> instance.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>This definition assumes the Measurer is already initialized.
In practice, there may be additional steps before the Search,
e.g. when the Manager configures the traffic profile
(either on the Measurer or on its tester sub-component directly)
and performs a warm-up (if the tester or the test procedure requires one).</t>

<t>It is the responsibility of the Measurer implementation to uphold
any requirements and assumptions present in MLRsearch specification,
e.g. Trial Forwarding Ratio not being larger than one.</t>

<t>Implementers have some freedom.
For example <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section 10)
gives some suggestions (but not requirements) related to
duplicated or reordered frames.
Implementations are RECOMMENDED to document their behavior
related to such freedoms in as detailed a way as possible.</t>

<t>It is RECOMMENDED to benchmark the test equipment first,
e.g. connect sender and receiver directly (without any SUT in the path),
find a load value that guarantees the Offered Load is not too far
from the Intended Load, and use that value as the Max Load value.
When testing the real SUT, it is RECOMMENDED to turn any big difference
between the Intended Load and the Offered Load into increased Trial Loss Ratio.</t>

<t>Neither of the two recommendations are made into requirements,
because it is not easy to tell when the difference is big enough,
in a way that would be disentangled from other Measurer freedoms.</t>

<t>For a simple example of a situation where the Offered Load cannot keep up
with the Intended Load, and the consequences on MLRsearch result,
see <xref target="hard-performance-limit">Hard Performance Limit</xref>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="controller"><name>Controller</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>The Controller is an abstract system component
that when called once with a Controller Input instance
repeatedly computes Trial Input instance for the Measurer,
obtains corresponding Trial Output instances,
and eventually returns a Controller Output instance.</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>Informally, the Controller has big freedom in selection of Trial Inputs,
and the implementations want to achieve all the Search Goals
in the shortest average time.</t>

<t>The Controller&#39;s role in optimizing the overall Search Duration
distinguishes MLRsearch algorithms from simpler search procedures.</t>

<t>Informally, each implementation can have different stopping conditions.
Goal Width is only one example.
In practice, implementation details do not matter,
as long as Goal Result instances are regular.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="manager"><name>Manager</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<t>The Manager is an abstract system component that is reponsible for
configuring other components, calling the Controller component once,
and for creating the test report following the reporting format as
defined in <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section 26).</t>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<t>The Manager initializes the SUT, the Measurer
(and the tester if independent from Measurer)
with their intended configurations before calling the Controller.</t>

<t>Note that <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section 7) already puts requirements on SUT setups:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
It is expected that all of the tests will be run without changing the
configuration or setup of the DUT in any way other than that required
to do the specific test. For example, it is not acceptable to change
the size of frame handling buffers between tests of frame handling
rates or to disable all but one transport protocol when testing the
throughput of that protocol.
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>It is REQUIRED for the test report to encompass all the SUT configuration
details, perhaps by describing a &quot;default&quot; configuration common for most tests
and only describe configuration changes if required by a specific test.</t>

<t>For example, <xref target="RFC5180"></xref> (Section 5.1.1) recommends testing jumbo frames
if SUT can forward them, even though they are outside the scope
of the 802.3 IEEE standard. In this case, it is fair
for the SUT default configuration to not support jumbo frames,
and only enable this support when testing jumbo traffic profiles,
as the handling of jumbo frames typically has different packet buffer
requirements and potentially higher processing overhead.
Ideally, non-jumbo frame sizes should also be tested on the jumbo-enabled setup.</t>

<t>The Manager does not need to be able to tweak any Search Goal attributes,
but it MUST report all applied attribute values even if not tweaked.</t>

<t>In principle, there should be a &quot;user&quot; (human or automated)
that &quot;starts&quot; or &quot;calls&quot; the Manager and receives the report.
The Manager MAY be able to be called more than once whis way,
thus triggering multiple independent Searches.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="compliance"><name>Compliance</name>

<t>This section discusses compliance relations between MLRsearch
and other test procedures.</t>

<section anchor="test-procedure-compliant-with-mlrsearch"><name>Test Procedure Compliant with MLRsearch</name>

<t>Any networking measurement setup that could be understood as consisting of
abstract components satisfying requirements
for the Measurer, the Controller and the Manager,
is considered to be compliant with MLRsearch specification.</t>

<t>These components can be seen as abstractions present in any testing procedure.
For example, there can be a single component acting both
as the Manager and the Controller, but as long as values of required attributes
of Search Goals and Goal Results are visible in the test report,
the Controller Input instance and Controller Output instance are implied.</t>

<t>For example, any setup for conditionally (or unconditionally)
compliant <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> throughput testing
can be understood as a MLRsearch architecture,
as long as there is enough data to reconstruct the Relevant Upper Bound.
See the next subsection for an equivalent Search Goal.</t>

<t>Any test procedure that can be understood as one call to the Manager of
MLRsearch architecture is said to be compliant with MLRsearch Specification.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="mlrsearch-compliant-with-rfc2544"><name>MLRsearch Compliant with RFC2544</name>

<t>The following Search Goal instance makes the corresponding Search Result
unconditionally compliant with <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> (Section 24).</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Goal Final Trial Duration = 60 seconds</t>
  <t>Goal Duration Sum = 60 seconds</t>
  <t>Goal Loss Ratio = 0%</t>
  <t>Goal Exceed Ratio = 0%</t>
</list></t>

<t>The latter two attributes, Goal Loss Ratio and Goal Exceed Ratio,
are enough to make the Search Goal conditionally compliant.
Adding the first attribute, Goal Final Trial Duration,
makes the Search Goal unconditionally compliant.</t>

<t>The second attribute (Goal Duration Sum) only prevents MLRsearch
from repeating zero-loss Full-Length Trials.</t>

<t>The presence of other Search Goals does not affect the compliance
of this Goal Result.
The Relevant Lower Bound and the Conditional Throughput are in this case
equal to each other, and the value is the <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> throughput.</t>

<t>Non-zero exceed ratio is not strictly disallowed, but it could
needlessly prolong the search when Low-Loss short trials are present.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="mlrsearch-compliant-with-tst009"><name>MLRsearch Compliant with TST009</name>

<t>One of the alternatives to <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> is Binary search with loss verification
as described in <xref target="TST009"></xref> (Section 12.3.3).</t>

<t>The idea there is to repeat high-loss trials, hoping for zero loss on second try,
so the results are closer to the noiseless end of performance sprectum,
thus more repeatable and comparable.</t>

<t>Only the variant with &quot;z = infinity&quot; is achievable with MLRsearch.</t>

<t>For example, for &quot;max(r) = 2&quot; variant, the following Search Goal instance
should be used to get compatible Search Result:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Goal Final Trial Duration = 60 seconds</t>
  <t>Goal Duration Sum = 120 seconds</t>
  <t>Goal Loss Ratio = 0%</t>
  <t>Goal Exceed Ratio = 50%</t>
</list></t>

<t>If the first 60s trial has zero loss, it is enough for MLRsearch to stop
measuring at that load, as even a second high-loss trial
would still fit within the exceed ratio.</t>

<t>But if the first trial is high-loss, MLRsearch needs to perform also
the second trial to classify that load.
Goal Duration Sum is twice as long as Goal Final Trial Duration,
so third full-length trial is never needed.</t>

</section>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="further-explanations"><name>Further Explanations</name>

<t>This chapter provides further explanations of MLRsearch behavior,
mainly in comparison to a simple bisection for <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> Throughput.</t>

<section anchor="binary-search"><name>Binary Search</name>

<t>A typical binary search implementation for <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>
tracks only the two tightest bounds.
To start, the search needs both Max Load and Min Load values.
Then, one trial is used to confirm Max Load is an Upper Bound,
and one trial to confirm Min Load is a Lower Bound.</t>

<t>Then, next Trial Load is chosen as the mean of the current tightest upper bound
and the current tightest lower bound, and becomes a new tightest bound
depending on the Trial Loss Ratio.</t>

<t>After some number of trials, the tightest lower bound becomes the throughput,
but <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> does not specify when, if ever, the search should stop.
In practice, the search stops either at some distance
between the tightest upper bound and the tightest lower bound,
or after some number of Trials.</t>

<t>For a given pair of Max Load and Min Load values,
there is one-to-one correspondence between number of Trials
and final distance between the tightest bounds.
Thus, the search always takes the same time,
assuming initial bounds are confirmed.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="stopping-conditions-and-precision"><name>Stopping Conditions and Precision</name>

<t>MLRsearch specification requires listing both Relevant Bounds for each
Search Goal, and the difference between the bounds implies
whether the result precision is achieved.
Therefore, it is not necessary to report the specific stopping condition used.</t>

<t>MLRsearch Implementations may use Goal Width
to allow direct control of result precision,
and indirect control of the Search Duration.</t>

<t>Other MLRsearch Implementations may use different stopping conditions;
for example based on the Search Duration, trading off precision control
for duration control.</t>

<t>Due to various possible time optimizations, there is no longer a strict
correspondence between the Search Duration and Goal Width values.
In practice, noisy SUT performance increases both average search time
and its variance.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="loss-ratios-and-loss-inversion"><name>Loss Ratios and Loss Inversion</name>

<t>The most obvious difference between MLRsearch and <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> binary search
is in the goals of the search.
<xref target="RFC2544"></xref> has a single goal, based on classifying a single full-length trial
as either zero-loss or non-zero-loss.
MLRsearch supports searching for multiple Search Goals at once,
usually differing in their Goal Loss Ratio values.</t>

<section anchor="single-goal-and-hard-bounds"><name>Single Goal and Hard Bounds</name>

<t>Each bound in <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> simple binary search is &quot;hard&quot;,
in the sense that all further Trial Load values
are smaller than any current upper bound and larger than any current lower bound.</t>

<t>This is also possible for MLRsearch Implementations,
when the search is started with only one Search Goal instance.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="multiple-goals-and-loss-inversion"><name>Multiple Goals and Loss Inversion</name>

<t>MLRsearch supports multiple Search Goals, making the search procedure
more complicated compared to binary search with single goal,
but most of the complications do not affect the final results much.
Except for one phenomenon: Loss Inversion.</t>

<t>Depending on Search Goal attributes, Load Classification results may be resistant
to small amounts of <xref target="inconsistent-trial-results">Inconsistent Trial Results</xref>.
But for larger amounts, a Load that is classified
as an Upper Bound for one Search Goal
may still be a Lower Bound for another Search Goal.
And, due to this other goal, MLRsearch will probably perform subsequent Trials
at Trial Loads even larger than the original value.</t>

<t>This introduces questions any many-goals search algorithm has to address.
What to do when all such larger load trials happen to have zero loss?
Does it mean the earlier upper bound was not real?
Does it mean the later Low-Loss trials are not considered a lower bound?</t>

<t>The situation where a smaller Load is classified as an Upper Bound,
while a larger Load is classified as a Lower Bound (for the same search goal),
is called Loss Inversion.</t>

<t>Conversely, only single-goal search algorithms can have hard bounds
that shield them from Loss Inversion.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="conservativeness-and-relevant-bounds"><name>Conservativeness and Relevant Bounds</name>

<t>MLRsearch is conservative when dealing with Loss Inversion:
the Upper Bound is considered real, and the Lower Bound
is considered to be a fluke, at least when computing the final result.</t>

<t>This is formalized using definitions of
<xref target="relevant-upper-bound">Relevant Upper Bound</xref> and
<xref target="relevant-lower-bound">Relevant Lower Bound</xref>.</t>

<t>The Relevant Upper Bound (for specific goal) is the smallest Load classified
as an Upper Bound. But the Relevant Lower Bound is not simply
the largest among Lower Bounds. It is the largest Load among Loads
that are Lower Bounds while also being smaller than the Relevant Upper Bound.</t>

<t>With these definitions, the Relevant Lower Bound is always smaller
than the Relevant Upper Bound (if both exist), and the two relevant bounds
are used analogously as the two tightest bounds in the binary search.
When they meet the stopping conditions, the Relevant Bounds are used in the output.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="consequences"><name>Consequences</name>

<t>The consequence of the way the Relevant Bounds are defined is that
every Trial Result can have an impact
on any current Relevant Bound larger than that Trial Load,
namely by becoming a new Upper Bound.</t>

<t>This also applies when that Load is measured
before another Load gets enough measurements to become a current Relevant Bound.</t>

<t>This also implies that if the SUT tested (or the Traffic Generator used)
needs a warm-up, it should be warmed up before starting the Search,
otherwise the first few measurements could become unjustly limiting.</t>

<t>For MLRsearch Implementations, it means it is better to measure
at smaller Loads first, so bounds found earlier are less likely
to get invalidated later.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="exceed-ratio-and-multiple-trials"><name>Exceed Ratio and Multiple Trials</name>

<t>The idea of performing multiple Trials at the same Trial Load comes from
a model where some Trial Results (those with high Trial Loss Ratio) are affected
by infrequent effects, causing poor repeatability of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> Throughput results.
See the discussion about noiseful and noiseless ends
of the SUT performance spectrum in section <xref target="dut-in-sut">DUT in SUT</xref>.
Stable results are closer to the noiseless end of the SUT performance spectrum,
so MLRsearch may need to allow some frequency of high-loss trials
to ignore the rare but big effects near the noiseful end.</t>

<t>For MLRsearch to perform such Trial Result filtering, it needs
a configuration option to tell how frequent the &quot;infrequent&quot; big loss can be.
This option is called the <xref target="goal-exceed-ratio">Goal Exceed Ratio</xref>.
It tells MLRsearch what ratio of trials (more specifically,
what ratio of Trial Effective Duration seconds)
can have a <xref target="trial-loss-ratio">Trial Loss Ratio</xref>
larger than the <xref target="goal-loss-ratio">Goal Loss Ratio</xref>
and still be classified as a <xref target="lower-bound">Lower Bound</xref>.</t>

<t>Zero exceed ratio means all Trials must have a Trial Loss Ratio
equal to or lower than the Goal Loss Ratio.</t>

<t>When more than one Trial is intended to classify a Load,
MLRsearch also needs something that controls the number of trials needed.
Therefore, each goal also has an attribute called Goal Duration Sum.</t>

<t>The meaning of a <xref target="goal-duration-sum">Goal Duration Sum</xref> is that
when a Load has (Full-Length) Trials
whose Trial Effective Durations when summed up give a value at least as big
as the Goal Duration Sum value,
the Load is guaranteed to be classified either as an Upper Bound
or a Lower Bound for that Search Goal instance.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="short-trials-and-duration-selection"><name>Short Trials and Duration Selection</name>

<t>MLRsearch requires each Searcg Goal to specify its Goal Final Trial Duration.</t>

<t>Section 24 of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> already anticipates possible time savings
when Short Trials are used.</t>

<t>Any MLRsearch Implementation may include its own configuration options
which control when and how MLRsearch chooses to use short trial durations.</t>

<t>While MLRsearch Implementations are free to use any logic to select
Trial Input values, comparability between MLRsearch Implementations
is only assured when the Load Classification logic
handles any possible set of Trial Results in the same way.</t>

<t>The presence of Short Trial Results complicates
the Load Classification logic, see details in
<xref target="load-classification-logic">Load Classification Logic</xref> chapter.</t>

<t>While the Load Classification algorithm is designed to avoid any unneeded Trials,
for explainability reasons it is recommended for users to use
such Controller Input instances that lead to all Trial Duration values
selected by Controller to be the same,
e.g. by setting any Goal Initial Trial Duration to be a single value
also used in all Goal Final Trial Duration attributes.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="generalized-throughput"><name>Generalized Throughput</name>

<t>Due to the fact that testing equipment takes the Intended Load
as an input parameter for a Trial measurement,
any load search algorithm needs to deal with Intended Load values internally.</t>

<t>But in the presence of Search Goals with a non-zero
<xref target="goal-loss-ratio">Goal Loss Ratio</xref>, the Load usually does not match
the user&#39;s intuition of what a throughput is.
The forwarding rate as defined in <xref target="RFC2285"></xref> (Section 3.6.1) is better,
but it is not obvious how to generalize it
for Loads with multiple Trials and a non-zero Goal Loss Ratio.</t>

<t>The best example is also the main motivation: hard performance limit.</t>

<section anchor="hard-performance-limit"><name>Hard Performance Limit</name>

<t>Even if bandwidth of the medium allows higher performance,
the SUT interfaces may have their additional own limitations,
e.g. a specific frames-per-second limit on the NIC (a common occurence).</t>

<t>Ideally, those should be known and provided as <xref target="max-load">Max Load</xref>.
But if Max Load is set larger than what the interface can receive or transmit,
there will be a &quot;hard limit&quot; behavior observed in Trial Results.</t>

<t>Imagine the hard limit is at hundred million frames per second (100 Mfps),
Max Load is larger, and the Goal Loss Ratio is 0.5%.
If DUT has no additional losses, 0.5% Trial Loss Ratio will be achieved
at Relevant Lower Bound of 100.5025 Mfps.
But it is not intuitive to report SUT performance as a value that is
larger than the known hard limit.
We need a generalization of RFC2544 throughput,
different from just the Relevant Lower Bound.</t>

<t>MLRsearch defines one such generalization,
the <xref target="conditional-throughput">Conditional Throughput</xref>.
It is the Trial Forwarding Rate from one of the Full-Length Trials
performed at the Relevant Lower Bound.
The algorithm to determine which trial exactly is in
<xref target="appendix-b-conditional-throughput">Appendix B: Conditional Throughput</xref>.</t>

<t>In the hard limit example, 100.5025 Mfps Load will still have
only 100.0 Mfps forwarding rate, nicely confirming the known limitation.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="performance-variability"><name>Performance Variability</name>

<t>With non-zero Goal Loss Ratio, and without hard performance limits,
Low-Loss trials at the same Load may achieve different Trial Forwarding Rate
values just due to DUT performance variability.</t>

<t>By comparing the best case (all Relevant Lower Bound trials have zero loss)
and the worst case (all Trial Loss Ratios at Relevant Lower Bound
are equal to the Goal Loss Ratio), we find the possible Conditional Throughput
values may have up to the Goal Loss Ratio relative difference.</t>

<t>Setting the Goal Width below the Goal Loss Ratio
may cause the Conditional Throughput for a larger Goal Loss Ratio to become smaller
than a Conditional Throughput for a goal with a lower Goal Loss Ratio,
which is counter-intuitive, considering they come from the same Search.
Therefore it is RECOMMENDED to set the Goal Width to a value no lower
than the Goal Loss Ratio of the higher-loss Search Goal.</t>

<t>Despite this variability, in practice Conditional Throughput behaves better
than Relevant Lower Bound for comparability purposes,
especially if deterministic Load selection is likely to produce
exactly the same Relevant Lower Bound value across multiple runs.</t>

  <t>Subceed ratio (T) is One minus the Goal Exceed Ratio (I) is called.</t>
  <t>Remaining sum (T) initially is full-lengths sum multiplied by subceed
ratio.</t>
  <t>Current loss ratio (T) initially is 100%.</t>
  <t>For each full-length trial result, sorted in increasing order by Trial
Loss Ratio:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>If remaining sum is not larger than zero, exit the loop.</t>
      <t>Set current loss ratio to this trial&#39;s Trial Loss Ratio (I).</t>
      <t>Decrease the remaining sum by this trial&#39;s Trial Effective Duration (I).</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Current forwarding ratio (T) is One minus the current loss ratio.</t>
  <t>Conditional Throughput (T) is the current forwarding ratio multiplied
by the Load value.</t>
</list></t>

<t>This shows that Conditional Throughput is partially related to Load Classification.
If a Load is classified as a Relevant Lower Bound for a Search Goal instance,
the Conditional Throughput comes from a Trial Result
that is guaranteed to have Trial Loss Ratio no larger than the Goal Loss Ratio.
The converse is not true if Goal Width is smaller than the Goal Loss Ratio,
as in that case it is possible for the Conditional Throughput
to be larger than the Relevant Upper Bound.</t>

<section anchor="sut-behaviors"><name>SUT Behaviors</name>

<t>In <xref target="dut-in-sut">DUT in SUT</xref>, the notion of noise has been introduced.
In this section we rely on new terms defined since then
to describe possible SUT behaviors more precisely.</t>

<t>From measurement point of view, noise is visible as inconsistent trial results.
See <xref target="inconsistent-trial-results">Inconsistent Trial Results</xref> for general points
and <xref target="loss-ratios-and-loss-inversion">Loss Ratios and Loss Inversion</xref>
for specifics when comparing different Load values.</t>

<t>Load Classification and Conditional Throughput apply to a single Load value,
but even the set of Trial Results measured at that Trial Load value
may appear inconsistent.</t>

<t>As MLRsearch aims to save time, it executes only a small number of Trials,
getting only a limited amount of information about SUT behavior.
It is useful to introduce an &quot;SUT expert&quot; point of view to contrast
with that limited information.</t>

<section anchor="expert-predictions"><name>Expert Predictions</name>

<t>Imagine that before the Search starts, a human expert had unlimited time
to measure SUT and obtain all reliable information about it.
The information is not perfect, as there is still random noise influencing SUT.
But the expert is familiar with possible noise events, even the rare ones,
and thus the expert can do probabilistic predictions about future Trial Outputs.</t>

<t>When several outcomes are possible,
the expert can asses probability of each outcome.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="exceed-probability"><name>Exceed Probability</name>

<t>When the Controller selects new Trial Duration and Trial Load,
and just before the Measurer starts performing the Trial,
the SUT expert can envision possible Trial Results.</t>

<t>With respect to a particular Search Goal instance, the possibilities
can be summarized into a single number: Exceed Probability.
It is the probability (according to the expert) that the measured
Trial Loss Ratio will be higher than the Goal Loss Ratio.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="trial-duration-dependence"><name>Trial Duration Dependence</name>

<t>When comparing Exceed Probability values for the same Trial Load value
but different Trial Duration values,
there are several patterns that commonly occur in practice.</t>

<section anchor="strong-increase"><name>Strong Increase</name>

<t>Exceed Probability is very low at short durations but very high at full-length.
This SUT behavior is undesirable, and may hint at faulty SUT,
e.g. SUT leaks resources and is unable to sustain the desired performance.</t>

<t>But this behavior is also seen when SUT uses large amount of buffers.
This is the main reasons users may want to set large Goal Final Trial Duration.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="mild-increase"><name>Mild Increase</name>

<t>Short trials have lower exceed probability, but the difference is not as high.
This behavior is quite common if the noise contains infrequent but large
loss spikes, as the more performant parts of a full-length trial
are unable to compensate for all the frame loss from a less performant part.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="independence"><name>Independence</name>

<t>Short trials have basically the same Exceed Probability as full-length trials.
This is possible only if loss spikes are small (so other parts can compensate)
and if Goal Loss Ratio is more than zero (otherwise other parts
cannot compensate at all).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="decrease"><name>Decrease</name>

<t>Short trials have larger Exceed Probability than full-length trials.
This can be possible only for non-zero Goal Loss Ratio,
for example if SUT needs to &quot;warm up&quot; to best performance within each trial.
Not sommonly seen in practice.</t>

<section anchor="example-search"><name>Example Search</name>

<t>The following example Search is related to
one hypothetical run of a Search test procedure
that has been started with multiple Search Goals.
Several points in time are chosen, in order to show how the logic works,
with specific sets of Trial Result available.
The trial results themselves are not very realistic, as
the intention is to show several corner cases of the logic.</t>

<t>In all Trials, the Effective Trial Duration is equal to Trial Duration.</t>

<t>Only one Trial Load is in focus, its value is one million frames per second.
Trial Results at other Trial Loads are not mentioned,
as the parts of logic present here do not depend on those.
In practice, Trial Results at other Load values would be present,
e.g. MLRsearch will look for a Lower Bound smaller than any Upper Bound found.</t>

<t>In all points in time, only one Search Goal instance is marked as &quot;in focus&quot;.
That explains Trial Duration of the new Trials,
but is otherwise unrelated to the logic applied.</t>

<t>MLRsearch Implementations are not required to &quot;focus&quot; on one goal at time,
but this example is useful to show a load can be classified
also for goals not &quot;in focus&quot;.</t>

<section anchor="example-goals"><name>Example Goals</name>

<t>The following four Search Goal instances are selected for the example Search.
Each goal has a readable name and dense code,
the code is useful to show Search Goal attribute values.</t>

<t>As the variable &quot;exceed coefficient&quot; does not depend on trial results,
it is also precomputed here.</t>

<t>Comments on point in time naming:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>When a name contains &quot;short&quot;, it means the added trial
had Trial Duration of 1 second, which is Short Trial for 3 of the Search Goals,
but it is a Full-Length Trial for the &quot;1s final&quot; goal.</t>
  <t>Similarly, &quot;long&quot; in name means the added trial
had Trial Duration of 60 seconds, which is Full-Length Trial for 3 goals
but Long Trial for the &quot;1s final&quot; goal.</t>
  <t>When a name contains &quot;good&quot; it means the added trial is Low-Loss Trial
for all the goals.</t>
  <t>When a name contains &quot;short bad&quot; it means the added trial is High-Loss Trial

<t>Due to zero Goal Loss Ratio, RFC2544 goal must have mild or strong increase
of exceed probability, so the one lossy trial would be lossy even if measured
at 60 second duration.
Due to zero exceed ratio, one High-Loss Trial is enough to preclude this Load
from becoming a Lower Bound for RFC2544. That is why this Load
is classified as an Upper Bound for RFC2544 this early.</t>

<t>As designed for TST009 goal, one Full-Length High-Loss Trial can be tolerated.
120s worth of 1-second trials is not useful, as this is allowed when
Exceed Probability does not depend on Trial Duration.
As Goal Loss Ratio is zero, it is not really possible for 60-second trials
to compensate for losses seen in 1-second results.
But Load Classification logic does not have that knowledge hardcoded,
so optimistic exceed ratio is still only 50%.</t>

<t>But the 0.1% Trial Loss Ratio is lower than &quot;20% exceed&quot; Goal Loss Ratio,
so this unexpected Full-Length Low-Loss trial changed the classification result
of this Load to Lower Bound.</t>

<t>This is the Low-Loss Trial the &quot;TST009&quot; goal was waiting for.
This Load is now classified for all goals, the search may end.
Or, more realistically, it can focus on larger load only,
as the three goals will want an Upper Bound (unless this Load is Max Load).</t>

<t>At the end of the hypothetical search, &quot;RFC2544&quot; goal has this load
classified as an Upper Bound, so it is not eligible for Conditional Throughput
calculations. But the remaining three goals calssify this Load as a Lower Bound,
and if we assume it has also became the Relevant Lower Bound,
we can compute Conditional Throughput values for all three goals.</t>

<t>As a reminder, the Load value is one million frames per second.</t>

<section anchor="goal-2"><name>Goal 2</name>

<t>The Conditional Throughput is computed from sorted list

<section anchor="appendix-a-load-classification"><name>Appendix A: Load Classification</name>

<t>This section specifies how to perform the Load Classification.</t>

<t>Any Trial Load value can be classified,
according to a given <xref target="search-goal">Search Goal</xref> instance.</t>

<t>The algorithm uses (some subsets of) the set of all available Trial Results
from Trials measured at a given Load at the end of the Search.</t>

<t>The block at the end of this appendix holds pseudocode
which computes two values, stored in variables named
<spanx style="verb">optimistic_is_lower</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">pessimistic_is_lower</spanx>.</t>

<t>The pseudocode happens to be valid Python code.</t>

<t>If values of both variables are computed to be true, the Load in question
is classified as a Lower Bound according to the given Search Goal instance.
If values of both variables are false, the Load is classified as an Upper Bound.
Otherwise, the load is classified as Undecided.</t>

<t>Some variable names are shortened in order to fit expressions in one line.
Namely, variables holding sum quantities end in <spanx style="verb">_s</spanx> instead of <spanx style="verb">_sum</spanx>,
and variables holding effective quantities start in <spanx style="verb">effect_</spanx>
instead of <spanx style="verb">effective_</spanx>.</t>

<t>The pseudocode expects the following variables to hold the following values:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="verb">goal_duration_s</spanx>: The Goal Duration Sum value of the given Search Goal.</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">goal_exceed_ratio</spanx>: The Goal Exceed Ratio value of the given Search Goal.</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">full_length_low_loss_s</spanx>: Sum of Trial Effective Durations across Trials
with Trial Duration at least equal to the Goal Final Trial Dduration
and with Trial Loss Ratio not higher than the Goal Loss Ratio
(across Full-Length Low-Loss Trials).</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">full_length_high_loss_s</spanx>: Sum of Trial Effective Durations across Trials
with Trial Duration at least equal to the Goal Final Trial Duration
and with Trial Loss Ratio higher than the Goal Loss Ratio
(across Full-Length High-Loss Trials).</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">short_low_loss_s</spanx>: Sum of Trial Effective Durations across Trials
with Trial Duration shorter than the Goal Final Trial Duration
and with Trial Loss Ratio not higher than the Goal Loss Ratio
(across Short Low-Loss Trials).</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">short_high_loss_s</spanx>: Sum of Trial Effective Durations across Trials
with Trial Duration shorter than the Goal Final Trial Duration
and with Trial Loss Ratio higher than the Goal Loss Ratio

<section anchor="appendix-b-conditional-throughput"><name>Appendix B: Conditional Throughput</name>

<t>This section specifies how to compute Conditional Throughput,
as referred to in section <xref target="conditional-throughput">Conditional Throughput</xref>.</t>

<t>Any Load value can be used as the basis for the following computation,
but only the Relevant Lower Bound (at the end of the Search)
leads to the value called the Conditional Throughput for a given Search Goal.</t>

<t>The algorithm uses (some subsets of) the set of all available Trial Results
from Trials measured at a given Load at the end of the Search.</t>

<t>The block at the end of this appendix holds pseudocode
which computes a value stored as variable <spanx style="verb">conditional_throughput</spanx>.</t>

<t>The pseudocode happens to be valid Python code.</t>

<t>Some variable names are shortened in order to fit expressions in one line.
Namely, variables holding sum quantities end in <spanx style="verb">_s</spanx> instead of <spanx style="verb">_sum</spanx>,
and variables holding effective quantities start in <spanx style="verb">effect_</spanx>
instead of <spanx style="verb">effective_</spanx>.</t>

<t>The pseudocode expects the following variables to hold the following values:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="verb">goal_duration_s</spanx>: The Goal Duration Sum value of the given Search Goal.</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">goal_exceed_ratio</spanx>: The Goal Exceed Ratio value of the given Search Goal.</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">full_length_low_loss_s</spanx>: Sum of Trial Effective Durations across Trials
with Trial Duration at least equal to the Goal Final Trial Dduration
and with Trial Loss Ratio not higher than the Goal Loss Ratio
(across Full-Length Low-Loss Trials).</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">full_length_high_loss_s</spanx>: Sum of Trial Effective Durations across Trials
with Trial Duration at least equal to the Goal Final Trial Duration
and with Trial Loss Ratio higher than the Goal Loss Ratio
(across Full-Length High-Loss Trials).</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">full_length_trials</spanx>: An iterable of all Trial Results from Trials
with Trial Duration at least equal to the Goal Final Trial Duration
(all Full-Length Trials), sorted by increasing Trial Loss Ratio.
One item <spanx style="verb">trial</spanx> is a composite with the following two attributes available:  <list style="symbols">
      <t><spanx style="verb">trial.loss_ratio</spanx>: The Trial Loss Ratio as measured for this Trial.</t>
      <t><spanx style="verb">trial.effect_duration</spanx>: The Trial Effective Duration of this Trial.</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>The code works correctly only when there if there is at least one
Trial Tesult measured at the given Load.</t>

<figure><sourcecode type="python"><![CDATA[
full_length_s = full_length_low_loss_s + full_length_high_loss_s
whole_s = max(goal_duration_s, full_length_s)
remaining = whole_s * (1.0 - goal_exceed_ratio)
quantile_loss_ratio = None
for trial in full_length_trials:
    if quantile_loss_ratio is None or remaining > 0.0:
        quantile_loss_ratio = trial.loss_ratio
        remaining -= trial.effect_duration
    else:
        break
else:
    if remaining > 0.0:
        quantile_loss_ratio = 1.0
conditional_throughput = intended_load * (1.0 - quantile_loss_ratio)
