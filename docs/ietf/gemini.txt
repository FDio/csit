Based on the review feedback and your replies, here is a summary of points that still require edits in the new version of the document. The points are categorized by priority.

### High-Priority Content and Clarity Edits

* **Abstract Wording**: The abstract needs to be reworded.
  * Avoid the term "throughput search," as reviewers noted it is not explicitly defined in RFC 2544.

    + 1. Ok, find new phrase.
      DONE:
      - throughput search
      + throughput

  * Reconsider the use of the word "extensions".

    + 2. Ok, find new phrase.
      DONE:
      - specifes extension
      + describes and alternative

  * Change "specifies" to "describes" to better suit an Informational RFC.

    + 3. Maybe? I do not agree with the modivation, but "describes" is ok for abstract.
      DONE:
      - specifes extension
      + describes and alternative

* **Binary Search Explanation**: The explanation of binary search needs to be more accessible to readers.
  * Move the "reminder" text about the [RFC2544] binary search from the end of Section 2.1 to a more prominent location, such as the Introduction.

    + 4. Ok, pick the location.
      TODO.

  * When this text is moved, clarify the claim that "each of the full 60-second trials doubles the precision".

    + 5. Ok, pick new phrase.
      DONE:
      -between search duration and achieved precision.
      -However, each of the full 60-second trials doubles the precision.
      +between search duration and achieved precision,
      +as each one of the full 60-second trials halves the interval of possible results.

* **Security Considerations Section**: This boilerplate section requires several clarifications based on reviewer feedback.
  * Clarify the sentence "Any implications for network security... SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production networks."
    The intended meaning is that DUTs should be benchmarked using their production security configurations.

    - No edits in boilerplate.

  * Elaborate on the statement that DUT/SUTs "SHOULD NOT include features that serve only to boost benchmark scores."
    The clarification should note that such capabilities may be present but MUST be disabled by default, and their use must be explicitly reported.

    - No edits in boilerplate.

  * Consider adding text about the need to protect benchmarking results, as they could be used by attackers to plan attacks.
    It could also be clarified that defining access control for results is out of the document's scope.

    - No edits in boilerplate.

* **Clarify Scope of Applicability**: The phrasing limiting the scope to systems with "x86/ARM CPUs" should be revised.
  The text should clarify that the methodology is applicable to any generic CPU but is especially motivated by the performance variability common in such systems.

  + 6. Ok, pick better phrase.
    DONE: Replaced "x86/ARM CPUs" -> "generic CPUs"

* **Reduce Section Overlap**: Review Section 1.2 ("Positioning within BMWG Methodologies") and Section 4.1 ("Scope") to reduce redundant content and improve clarity.

  + 7. Maybe ok, not clear how to improve.
    TODO.

### Medium-Priority Edits

* **Add Forward References**:
  * In the Introduction, add forward references to the Rationale section (Section 6) to give readers better context early on.

    + 8. Ok.
      DONE added new paragraph:
      For first time readers, the information in
      [MLRsearch Specification](#mlrsearch-specification) might feel
      dense and lacking motivation. Subsequent sections are there to provide explanations,
      making [MLRsearch Specification](#mlrsearch-specification)
      more approachable on repeated reads.

  * In Section 4.2 ("Architecture Overview"), add forward references
    for the terms "Regular Search Results" and "Irregular Search Results" to their definitions in Section 4.8.4.

    + 9. Maybe? Not sure yet. Perhaps irregular only?
      DONE: For ir/regular result only.

* **Rename Section Title**: The title of Section 2.2, "DUT in SUT," should be rephrased to avoid using acronyms that are defined within the section itself.

  + 10. DONE before -15:
    Fixed by moving the paragraph starting with "Section 19 of [RFC2544]" before the RFC2285 definitions.

* **Elaborate on Non-Zero Loss**: In Section 2.4 ("Throughput with Non-Zero Loss"), consider adding a sentence noting that
  the impact of a given loss ratio varies depending on the upper-layer protocol and application.

  + 11. Ok, but not clear on sentence.
    DONE. Updated paragraph:
    For more information, see Section 5 of an earlier draft [Lencze-Shima]
    (and references there) for few extreme cases, confirming that
    each protocol and application can have different realistic loss ratio value.

* **Review "Conditional MUST" Usage**: Re-evaluate the use of "conditional requirements" (e.g., the use of MUST in Section 4.5.5)
  to ensure the language is unambiguous and justified, as this usage is not explicitly covered by RFC2119 / RFC8174.

  - No, current text looks good enough.

### Low-Priority Stylistic and Formatting Edits

* **Add Architecture Diagram**: Consider adding a simple diagram to Section 4.2 to visually represent the relationship between the Manager, Controller, and Measurer components.

  - Maybe? I prefer no.

* **General Grammar and Wording Review**:
  * Perform a consistency check on the capitalization of defined terms throughout the document.

    - Maybe but hard to do reliably. For now, no.

  * Conduct a general grammar review, with a focus on the correct use of definite and indefinite articles ("a," "the").

    - Not yet.

  * Check for awkward phrasing that may have been caused by the automatic linking tool, such as "Section X (Section X)".

    + 12. DONE before -15. Yes for Appendices, no otherwise.
