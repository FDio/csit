<?line 72?>

<t>This document describes an alternative to &quot;Benchmarking Methodology for
Network Interconnect Devices&quot; (RFC 2544) throughput by
defining a new methodology called Multiple Loss Ratio search
(MLRsearch). MLRsearch aims to minimize search duration,
support multiple loss ratio searches, and improve result repeatability
and comparability.</t>

<t>MLRsearch is motivated by the pressing need to address the challenges of
evaluating and testing the various data plane solutions, especially in
software-based networking systems based on Commercial Off-the-Shelf
(COTS) CPU hardware vs purpose-built ASIC / NPU / FPGA hardware.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>This document describes the Multiple Loss Ratio search
(MLRsearch) methodology, optimized for determining data plane
throughput in software-based networking functions running on commodity systems with
generic CPUs (vs purpose-built ASIC / NPU / FPGA). Such network
functions can be deployed on dedicated physical appliance (e.g., a
standalone hardware device) or as virtual appliance (e.g., Virtual
Network Function running on shared servers in the compute cloud).</t>

<t>This document tightly couples terminology and methodology aspects.
Instead of a separate terminology section, Table of Contents
subsections of <xref target="mlrsearch-specification">MLRsearch Specification</xref>
act as list of newly defined terms.
If a phrase appears with first letters capitalized, it likely refers
to a specific term defined in eponymous subsection
of <xref target="mlrsearch-specification">MLRsearch Specification</xref>.</t>

<t>For first time readers, the information in
<xref target="mlrsearch-specification">MLRsearch Specification</xref> might feel
dense and lacking motivation. Subsequent sections are there to provide explanations,
making <xref target="mlrsearch-specification">MLRsearch Specification</xref>
more approachable on repeated reads.</t>

<section anchor="purpose"><name>Purpose</name>

<t>The purpose of this document is to describe the Multiple Loss Ratio search
(MLRsearch) methodology, optimized for determining
data plane throughput in software-based networking devices and functions.</t>

<t>Applying the <xref target="plain-bisect">Plain Bisect</xref>
to software devices under test (DUTs) results in several problems:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Plain bisect takes a long time as most trials are done far from the
eventually found throughput.</t>
  <t>The required final trial duration and pauses between trials
prolong the overall search duration.</t>
  <t>Software DUTs show noisy trial results,
leading to a big spread of possible discovered throughput values.</t>
  <t>Throughput requires a loss of exactly zero frames, but the industry best practices
frequently allow for low but non-zero losses tolerance (<xref target="Y.1564"></xref>, test-equipment manuals).</t>
  <t>The definition of throughput is not clear when trial results are inconsistent.
(e.g., when successive trials at the same - or even a higher - offered
load yield different loss ratios, the classical <xref target="RFC1242"></xref> / <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>
throughput metric can no longer be pinned to a single, unambiguous
value.)</t>
</list></t>

<t>To address these problems,
early MLRsearch implementations employed the following enhancements:</t>

<t><list style="numbers" type="1">
  <t>Allow multiple short trials instead of one big trial per load.
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Optionally, tolerate a percentage of trial results with higher loss.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Allow searching for multiple <xref target="search-goal">Search Goals</xref>, with differing loss ratios.
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Any trial result can affect each Search Goal in principle.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Insert multiple coarse targets for each Search Goal, earlier ones need
to spend less time on trials.
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Earlier targets also aim for lesser precision.</t>
      <t>Use Forwarding Rate (FR) at Maximum Offered Load (FRMOL), as defined
in Section 3.6.2 of <xref target="RFC2285"></xref>, to initialize bounds.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Clarify handling of inconsistent trial results.
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Reported throughput should be smaller than the smallest load with high loss.</t>
      <t>Measure smaller load candidates first.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Apply several time-saving load selection heuristics that deliberately
prevent the bounds from narrowing unnecessarily.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Enhancements 1, 2 and partly 4 are formalized as MLRsearch Specification
within this document, other implementation details are out the scope.</t>

<t>The remaining enhancements are treated as implementation details,
thus achieving high comparability without limiting future improvements.</t>

<t>MLRsearch configuration supports both conservative settings
and aggressive settings. Results unconditionally compliant with <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>
are possible with conservative enough settings,
but without much improvement on search duration and repeatability - see
<xref target="mlrsearch-compliant-with-rfc-2544">MLRsearch Compliant with RFC 2544</xref>.
Conversely, aggressive settings lead to shorter search durations
and better repeatability, but the results are not compliant with <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>.
Exact settings are not specified, but see the discussion in
<xref target="overview-of-rfc-2544-problems">Overview of RFC 2544 Problems</xref>
for the impact of different settings on result quality.</t>

<t>This document does not change or obsolete any part of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="positioning-within-bmwg-methodologies"><name>Positioning within BMWG Methodologies</name>

<t>The Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) produces recommendations (RFCs)
that describe various benchmarking methodologies for use in a controlled laboratory environment.
A large number of these benchmarks are based on the terminology from <xref target="RFC1242"></xref>
and the foundational methodology from <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>.
A common pattern has emerged where BMWG documents reference the methodology of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>
and augment it with specific requirements for testing particular network systems or protocols,
without modifying the core benchmark definitions.</t>

<t>While BMWG documents are formally recommendations,
they are widely treated as industry norms to ensure the comparability of results between different labs.
The set of benchmarks defined in <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>, in particular,
became a de facto standard for performance testing.
In this context, the MLRsearch Specification formally defines a new
class of benchmarks that fits within the wider <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> framework
(see <xref target="scope">Scope </xref>).</t>

<t>A primary consideration in the design of MLRsearch is the trade-off
between configurability and comparability. The methodology&#39;s flexibility,
especially the ability to define various sets of Search Goals,
supporting both single-goal and multiple-goal benchmarks in an unified way
is powerful for detailed characterization and internal testing.
However, this same flexibility is detrimental to inter-lab comparability
unless a specific, common set of Search Goals is agreed upon.</t>

<t>Therefore, MLRsearch should not be seen as a direct extension
nor a replacement for the <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> Throughput benchmark.
Instead, this document provides a foundational methodology
that future BMWG documents can use to define new, specific, and comparable benchmarks
by mandating particular Search Goal configurations.
For operators of existing test procedures, it is worth noting
that many test setups measuring <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> Throughput
can be adapted to produce results compliant with the MLRsearch Specification,
often without affecting Trials,
merely by augmenting the content of the final test report.</t>

<section anchor="overview-of-rfc-2544-problems"><name>Overview of RFC 2544 Problems</name>

<t>This section describes the problems affecting usability
of various performance testing methodologies,
mainly the <xref target="plain-bisect">Plain Bisect</xref> for <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> unconditionally compliant throughput.</t>

<section anchor="plain-bisect"><name>Plain Bisect</name>

<t>While <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> offers some flexibility when searching for throughput,
a particular algorithm is frequently used as a starting point,
as it is the simplest one among those that offer reasonable effectivity.</t>

<t>This algorithm is based on binary search,
but does not have a specific name when searching for throughput.
In this document we call that algorithm the &quot;plain bisect&quot;.
Here is its description based on Sections 24 and 26 of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>
and in Section 12.3.2 of <xref target="TST009"></xref>:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Set Max = line-rate and Min = a proven loss-free load.</t>
  <t>Compute a midpoint, the arithmetic mean of current Min and Max values.</t>
  <t>Run a single 60-second trial at the midpoint.</t>
  <t>Zero-loss -&gt; midpoint becomes new Min; any loss-&gt; new Max.</t>
  <t>Repeat until the Max-Min gap meets the desired precision.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Small modifications related to initial Min and Max values are allowed.</t>

<t>For larger modifications, such as using a different way to compute the midpoint,
a more generic name should be used, such as &quot;binary search&quot;.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="long-search-duration"><name>Long Search Duration</name>

<t>The proliferation of software DUTs, with frequent software updates
and a number of different frame processing modes and configurations,
has increased both the number of performance tests
required to verify the DUT update and the frequency of running those tests.
This makes the overall test execution time even more important than before.</t>

<t>The throughput definition per <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> restricts the potential
for time-efficiency improvements.
The <xref target="plain-bisect">Plain Bisect</xref>, when used in a manner unconditionally compliant
with <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>, is excessively slow due to two main factors.</t>

<t>Firstly, a significant amount of time is spent on trials
with loads that, in retrospect, are far from the final determined throughput.</t>

<t>Secondly, <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> does not specify any stopping condition for
throughput search, so users of testing equipment implementing the
procedure already have access to a limited trade-off
between search duration and achieved precision,
as each one of the full 60-second trials halves the interval of possible results.</t>

<t>As such, not many trials can be removed without a substantial loss of precision.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="dut-in-sut"><name>DUT in SUT</name>

<t>Section 19 of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> specifies a test setup with an external tester
stimulating the networking system, treating it either as a single
Device Under Test (DUT), or as a system of devices, a System Under
Test (SUT).</t>

<t><xref target="RFC2285"></xref> defines:</t>

<t>DUT as:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The network frame forwarding device to which stimulus is offered and
response measured Section 3.1.1 of <xref target="RFC2285"></xref>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>SUT as:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The collective set of network devices as a single entity to which
stimulus is offered and response measured Section 3.1.2 of <xref target="RFC2285"></xref>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>For software-based data-plane forwarding running on commodity x86/ARM
CPUs, the SUT comprises not only the forwarding application itself, the
DUT, but the entire execution environment: host hardware, firmware and
kernel/hypervisor services, as well as any other software workloads
that share the same CPUs, memory and I/O resources.</t>

<t>Given that a SUT is a shared multi-tenant environment,
the DUT might inadvertently
experience interference from the operating system
or from other software operating on the same server.</t>

<t>Some of this interference can be mitigated.
For instance, in multi-core CPU systems, pinning DUT program threads to
specific CPU cores
and isolating those cores can prevent context switching.</t>

<t>Despite taking all feasible precautions, some adverse effects may still impact
the DUT&#39;s network performance.
In this document, these effects are collectively
referred to as SUT noise, even if the effects are not as unpredictable
as what other engineering disciplines call noise.</t>

<t>A DUT can also exhibit fluctuating performance itself,
for reasons not related to the rest of SUT. For example, this can be
due to pauses in execution as needed for internal stateful processing.
In many cases this may be an expected per-design behavior,
as it would be observable even in a hypothetical scenario
where all sources of SUT noise are eliminated.
Such behavior affects trial results in a way similar to SUT noise.
As the two phenomena are hard to distinguish,
in this document the term &#39;noise&#39; is used to encompass
both the internal performance fluctuations of the DUT
and the genuine noise of the SUT.</t>

<t>A simple model of SUT performance consists of an idealized noiseless performance,
and additional noise effects.
For a specific SUT, the noiseless performance is assumed to be constant,
with all observed performance variations being attributed to noise.
The impact of the noise can vary in time, sometimes wildly,
even within a single trial.
The noise can sometimes be negligible, but frequently
it lowers the observed SUT performance as observed in trial results.</t>

<t>In this simple model, a SUT does not have a single performance value, it has a spectrum.
One end of the spectrum is the idealized noiseless performance value,
the other end can be called a noiseful performance.
In practice, trial results close to the noiseful end of the spectrum
happen only rarely.
The worse a possible performance value is, the more rarely it is seen in a trial.
Therefore, the extreme noiseful end of the SUT spectrum is not observable
among trial results.</t>

<t>Furthermore, the extreme noiseless end of the SUT spectrum is unlikely
to be observable, this time because minor noise events almost always
occur during each trial, nudging the measured performance slightly
below the theoretical maximum.</t>

<t>Unless specified otherwise, this document&#39;s focus is
on the potentially observable ends of the SUT performance spectrum,
as opposed to the extreme ones.</t>

<t>When focusing on the DUT, the benchmarking effort should ideally aim
to eliminate only the SUT noise from SUT measurements.
However, this is currently not feasible in practice,
as there are no realistic enough models that would be capable
to distinguish SUT noise from DUT fluctuations
(based on the available literature at the time of writing).</t>

<t>Provided SUT execution environment and any co-resident workloads place
only negligible demands on SUT shared resources, so that
the DUT remains the principal performance limiter,
the DUT&#39;s ideal noiseless performance is defined
as the noiseless end of the SUT performance spectrum.</t>

<t>Note that by this definition, DUT noiseless performance
also minimizes the impact of DUT fluctuations, as much as realistically possible
for a given trial duration.</t>

<t>The MLRsearch methodology aims to solve the DUT in SUT problem
by estimating the noiseless end of the SUT performance spectrum
using a limited number of trial results.</t>

<t>Improvements to the throughput search algorithm, aimed at better dealing
with software networking SUT and DUT setups, should adopt methods that
explicitly model SUT-generated noise, enabling to derive surrogate
metrics that approximate the (proxies for) DUT noiseless performance
across a range of SUT noise-tolerance levels.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="repeatability-and-comparability"><name>Repeatability and Comparability</name>

<t><xref target="RFC2544"></xref> does not suggest repeating throughput search. Also, note that
from simply one discovered throughput value,
it cannot be determined how repeatable that value is.
Unsatisfactory repeatability then leads to unacceptable comparability,
as different benchmarking teams may obtain varying throughput values
for the same SUT, exceeding the expected differences from search precision.
Repeatability is important also when the test procedure is kept the same,
but SUT is varied in small ways. For example, during development
of software-based DUTs, repeatability is needed to detect small regressions.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC2544"></xref> throughput requirements (60-second trial and
no tolerance of a single frame loss) affect the throughput result as follows:</t>

<t>The SUT behavior close to the noiseful end of its performance spectrum
consists of rare occasions of significantly low performance,
but the long trial duration makes those occasions not so rare on the trial level.
Therefore, the <xref target="plain-bisect">Plain Bisect</xref> results tend to spread away from the noiseless end
of SUT performance spectrum, more frequently and more widely than shorter
trials would, thus causing unacceptable throughput repeatability.</t>

<t>The repeatability problem can be better addressed by defining a search procedure
that identifies a consistent level of performance,
even if it does not meet the strict definition of throughput in <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>.</t>

<t>According to the SUT performance spectrum model, better repeatability
will be at the noiseless end of the spectrum.
Therefore, solutions to the DUT in SUT problem
will help also with the repeatability problem.</t>

<t>Conversely, any alteration to <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> throughput search
that improves repeatability should be considered
as less dependent on the SUT noise.</t>

<t>An alternative option is to simply run a search multiple times, and
report some statistics (e.g., average and standard deviation, and/or
percentiles like p95).</t>

<t>This can be used for a subset of tests deemed more important,
but it makes the search duration problem even more pronounced.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="throughput-with-non-zero-loss"><name>Throughput with Non-Zero Loss</name>

<dl>
  <dt>Section 3.17 of <xref target="RFC1242"></xref> defines throughput as:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>The maximum rate at which none of the offered frames
are dropped by the device.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>Then, it says:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>Since even the loss of one frame in a
data stream can cause significant delays while
waiting for the higher-level protocols to time out,
it is useful to know the actual maximum data
rate that the device can support.</t>
  </dd>
</dl>

<t>However, many benchmarking teams accept a low,
non-zero loss ratio as the goal for their load search.</t>

<t>Motivations are many:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Networking protocols tolerate frame loss better,
compared to the time when <xref target="RFC1242"></xref> and <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> were specified.</t>
  <t>Increased link speeds require trials sending more frames within the same duration,
increasing the chance of a small SUT performance fluctuation
being enough to cause frame loss.</t>
  <t>Because noise-related drops usually arrive in small bursts, their
impact on the trial&#39;s overall frame loss ratio is diluted by the
longer intervals in which the SUT operates close to its noiseless
performance; consequently, the averaged Trial Loss Ratio can still
end up below the specified Goal Loss Ratio value.</t>
  <t>If an approximation of the SUT noise impact on the Trial Loss Ratio is known,
it can be set as the Goal Loss Ratio (see definitions of
Trial and Goal terms in <xref target="trial-terms">Trial Terms</xref> and <xref target="goal-terms">Goal Terms</xref>).</t>
</list></t>

<t>For more information, see Section 5 of an earlier draft <xref target="Lencze-Shima"></xref>
(and references there) for few extreme cases, confirming that
each protocol and application can have different realistic loss ratio value.</t>

<t>Regardless of the validity of all similar motivations,
support for non-zero loss goals makes a
search algorithm applicable for a wider range of use cases
than the approach defined in <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>.</t>

<t>Furthermore, allowing users to specify multiple loss ratio values,
and enabling a single search to find all relevant bounds,
significantly enhances the usefulness of the search algorithm.</t>

<t>Searching for multiple Search Goals also helps to describe the SUT performance
spectrum better than the result of a single Search Goal.
For example, the repeated wide gap between zero and non-zero loss loads
indicates the noise has a large impact on the observed performance,
which is not evident from a single goal load search procedure result.</t>

<t>It is easy to modify the <xref target="plain-bisect">Plain Bisect</xref> to find a lower bound
for the load that satisfies a non-zero Goal Loss Ratio.
But it is not that obvious how to search for multiple goals at once,
hence the support for multiple Search Goals remains a problem.</t>

<t>At the time of writing there does not seem to be a consensus in the industry
on which loss ratio value is the best.
For users, performance of higher protocol layers is important, for
example, goodput of TCP connection (TCP throughput, <xref target="RFC6349"></xref>), but relationship
between goodput and loss ratio is not simple. Refer to
<xref target="Lencze-Kovacs-Shima"></xref> for examples of various corner cases,
Section 3 of <xref target="RFC6349"></xref> for loss ratios acceptable for an accurate
measurement of TCP throughput, and <xref target="Ott-Mathis-Semke-Mahdavi"></xref> for
models and calculations of TCP performance in presence of packet loss.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="inconsistent-trial-results"><name>Inconsistent Trial Results</name>

<t>While performing throughput search by executing a sequence of
measurement trials, there is a risk of encountering inconsistencies
between trial results.</t>

<t>Examples include, but are not limited to:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A trial at the same load (same or different trial duration) results
in a different Trial Loss Ratio.</t>
  <t>A trial at a larger load (same or different trial duration) results
in a lower Trial Loss Ratio.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The <xref target="plain-bisect">Plain Bisect</xref> never encounters inconsistent trials.
But <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> hints about the possibility of inconsistent trial results,
in two places in its text.
The first place is Section 24 of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>,
where full trial durations are required,
presumably because they can be inconsistent with the results
from short trial durations.
The second place is Section 26.3 of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>,
where two successive zero-loss trials
are recommended, presumably because after one zero-loss trial
there can be a subsequent inconsistent non-zero-loss trial.</t>

<t>A robust throughput search algorithm needs to decide how to continue
the search in the presence of such inconsistencies.
Definitions of throughput in <xref target="RFC1242"></xref> and <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> are not specific enough
to imply a unique way of handling such inconsistencies.</t>

<t>Ideally, there will be a definition of a new quantity which both generalizes
throughput for non-zero Goal Loss Ratio values
(and other possible repeatability enhancements), while being precise enough
to force a specific way to resolve trial result inconsistencies.
But until such a definition is agreed upon, the correct way to handle
inconsistent trial results remains an open problem.</t>

<t>Relevant Lower Bound is the MLRsearch term that addresses this problem.</t>

<section anchor="out-of-scope"><name>Out of Scope</name>

<t>The following aspects are explicitly out of the normative scope of this document:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>This specification does not mandate or recommend any single,
universal Search Goal configuration for all use cases.
The selection of Search Goal parameters is left
to the operator of the test procedure or may be defined by future specifications.</t>
  <t>The internal heuristics or algorithms used by the Controller to select Trial Input values
(e.g., the load selection strategy) are considered implementation details.</t>
  <t>The potential for, and the effects of, interference between different Search Goal instances
within a multiple-goal search are considered outside the normative scope of this specification.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="architecture-overview"><name>Architecture Overview</name>

<t>Although the normative text references only terminology that has already
been introduced, explanatory passages beside it sometimes profit from
terms that are defined later in the document. To keep the initial
read-through clear, this informative section offers a concise, top-down
sketch of the complete MLRsearch architecture.</t>

<t>The architecture is modelled as a set of abstract, interacting
components. Information exchange between components is expressed in an
imperative-programming style: one component &quot;calls&quot; another, supplying
inputs (arguments) and receiving outputs (return values). This notation
is purely conceptual; actual implementations need not exchange explicit
messages. When the text contrasts alternative behaviours, it refers to
the different implementations of the same component.</t>

<t>A test procedure is considered compliant with the MLRsearch
Specification if it can be conceptually decomposed into the abstract
components defined herein, and each component satisfies the
requirements defined for its corresponding MLRsearch element.</t>

<t>The Measurer component is tasked to perform Trials,
the Controller component is tasked to select Trial Durations and Loads,
the Manager component is tasked to pre-configure involved entities
and to produce the Test Report.
The Test Report explicitly states Search Goals (as Controller Input)
and corresponding Goal Results (Controller Output).</t>

<t>This constitutes one benchmark (single-goal or multi-goal).
Repeated or slightly differing benchmarks are realized
by calling Controller once for each benchmark.</t>

<t>The Manager calls a Controller once,
and the Controller then invokes the Measurer repeatedly
until Controller decides it has enough information to return outputs.</t>

<t>The part during which the Controller invokes the Measurer is termed the
Search. Any work the Manager performs either before invoking the
Controller or after Controller returns, falls outside the scope of the
Search.</t>

<t>MLRsearch Specification prescribes <xref target="regular-goal-result">Regular Goal Results</xref>
and recommends corresponding search completion conditions.
<xref target="irregular-goal-result">Irregular Goal Results</xref> are also allowed,
they have different requirements and their corresponding stopping conditions are out of scope.
The Search Result is the combination of regular and irregular results for each goal.</t>

<t>Search Results are based on Load Classification. When measured enough,
a chosen Load can either achieve or fail each Search Goal
(separately), thus becoming a Lower Bound or an Upper Bound for that
Search Goal.</t>

<t>When the Relevant Lower Bound is close enough to Relevant Upper Bound
according to Goal Width, the Regular Goal Result is found.
Search stops when all Regular Goal Results are found,
or when some Search Goals are proven to have only Irregular Goal Results.</t>

<section anchor="test-report"><name>Test Report</name>

<t>A primary responsibility of the Manager is to produce a Test Report,
which serves as the final and formal output of the test procedure.</t>

<t>This document does not provide a single, complete, normative definition
for the structure of the Test Report. For example, Test Report may contain
results for a single benchmark, or it could aggregate results of many benchmarks.</t>

<t>Instead, normative requirements for the content of the Test Report
are specified throughout this document in conjunction
with the definitions of the quantities and procedures to which they apply.
Readers should note that any clause requiring a value to be &quot;reported&quot;
or &quot;stated in the test report&quot; constitutes a normative requirement
on the content of this final artifact.</t>

<t>Even where not stated explicitly, the &quot;Reporting format&quot;
paragraphs in <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> sections are still requirements on Test Report
if they apply to a MLRsearch benchmark.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="behavior-correctness"><name>Behavior Correctness</name>

<t>MLRsearch Specification by itself does not guarantee that
the Search ends in finite time, as the freedom the Controller has
for Load selection also allows for clearly deficient choices.</t>

<t>For deeper insights on these matters, refer to <xref target="FDio-CSIT-MLRsearch"></xref>.</t>

<t>The primary MLRsearch implementation, used as the prototype
for this specification, is <xref target="PyPI-MLRsearch"></xref>.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="quantities"><name>Quantities</name>

<t>MLRsearch Specification
uses a number of specific quantities,
some of them can be expressed in several different units.</t>

<t>In general, MLRsearch Specification does not require particular units to be used,
but it is REQUIRED for the test report to state all the units.
For example, ratio quantities can be dimensionless numbers between zero and one,
but may be expressed as percentages instead.</t>

<t>For convenience, a group of quantities can be treated as a composite quantity.
One constituent of a composite quantity is called an attribute.
A group of attribute values is called an instance of that composite quantity.</t>

<t>Some attributes may depend on others and can be calculated from other
attributes. Such quantities are called derived quantities.</t>

<section anchor="current-and-final-values"><name>Current and Final Values</name>

<t>Some quantities are defined in a way that makes it possible to compute their
values in the middle of a Search. Other quantities are specified so
that their values can be computed only after a Search ends. Some
quantities are important only after a Search ended, but their values
are computable also before a Search ends.</t>

<t>For a quantity that is computable before a Search ends,
the adjective <strong>current</strong> is used to mark a value of that quantity
available before the Search ends.
When such value is relevant for the search result, the adjective <strong>final</strong>
is used to denote the value of that quantity at the end of the Search.</t>

<t>If a time evolution of such a dynamic quantity is guided by
configuration quantities, those adjectives can be used to distinguish
quantities. For example, if the current value of &quot;duration&quot;
(dynamic quantity) increases from &quot;initial duration&quot; to &quot;final
duration&quot; (configuration quantities), all the quoted names denote
separate but related quantities. As the naming suggests, the final
value of &quot;duration&quot; is expected to be equal to &quot;final duration&quot; value.</t>

<section anchor="existing-terms"><name>Existing Terms</name>

<t>This specification relies on the following three documents that should
be consulted before attempting to make use of this document:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>&quot;Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect Devices&quot; <xref target="RFC1242"></xref>
contains basic term definitions.</t>
  <t>&quot;Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices&quot; <xref target="RFC2285"></xref> adds
more terms and discussions, describing some known network
benchmarking situations in a more precise way.</t>
  <t>&quot;Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices&quot;
 <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> contains discussions about terms and additional
 methodology requirements.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Definitions of some central terms from above documents are copied and
discussed in the following subsections.</t>

<t>Definition:</t>

<dl>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>A particular test consists of multiple trials.  Each trial returns
one piece of information, for example the loss rate at a particular
input frame rate.  Each trial consists of a number of phases:</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>a) If the DUT is a router, send the routing update to the &quot;input&quot;
port and pause two seconds to be sure that the routing has settled.</t>

  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>b)  Send the &quot;learning frames&quot; to the &quot;output&quot; port and wait 2
seconds to be sure that the learning has settled.  Bridge learning
frames are frames with source addresses that are the same as the
destination addresses used by the test frames.  Learning frames for
other protocols are used to prime the address resolution tables in
the DUT.  The formats of the learning frame that should be used are
shown in the Test Frame Formats document.</t>

<section anchor="trial-load"><name>Trial Load</name>

<t>Definition:</t>

<dl>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>Trial Load is the per-interface Intended Load for a Trial.</t>
  </dd>
</dl>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<dl>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>Trial Load is equivalent to the quantities defined
as constant load (Section 3.4 of <xref target="RFC1242"></xref>),
data rate (Section 14 of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>),
and Intended Load (Section 3.5.1 of <xref target="RFC2285"></xref>),
in the sense that all three definitions specify that this value
applies to one (input or output) interface.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>For specification purposes, it is assumed that this is a constant load by default,
as specified in Section 3.4 of <xref target="RFC1242"></xref>).
Informally, Traffic Load is a single number that can &quot;scale&quot; any traffic pattern
as long as the intuition of load intended against a single interface can be applied.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>It MAY be possible to use a Trial Load value to describe a non-constant traffic
(using average load when the traffic consists of repeated bursts of frames
e.g., as suggested in Section 21 of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>).
In the case of a non-constant load, the Test Report
MUST explicitly mention how exactly non-constant the traffic is
and how it reacts to Traffic Load value.
But the rest of the MLRsearch Specification assumes that is not the case,
to avoid discussing corner cases (e.g., which values are possible within medium limitations).</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>Similarly, traffic patterns where different interfaces are subject to different loads
MAY be described by a single Trial Load value (e.g. using largest load among interfaces),
but again the Test Report MUST explicitly describe how the traffic pattern
reacts to Traffic Load value,
and this specification does not discuss all the implications of that approach.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>In the common case of bidirectional traffic, as described in
Section 14. Bidirectional Traffic of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>,
Trial Load is the data rate per direction, half of aggregate data rate.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>Traffic patterns where a single Trial Load does not describe their scaling
cannot be used for MLRsearch benchmarks.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>Similarly to Trial Duration, some Measurers MAY limit the possible values
of Trial Load. Contrary to Trial Duration,
documenting such behavior in the test report is OPTIONAL.
This is because the load differences are negligible (and frequently
undocumented) in practice.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>The Controller MAY select Trial Load and Trial Duration values in a way
that would not be possible to achieve using any integer number of data frames.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>If a particular Trial Load value is not tied to a single Trial,
e.g., if there are no Trials yet or if there are multiple Trials,
this document uses a shorthand <strong>Load</strong>.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>The test report MAY present the aggregate load across multiple
interfaces, treating it as the same quantity expressed using different
units. Each reported Trial Load value MUST state unambiguously whether
it refers to (i) a single interface, (ii) a specified subset of
interfaces (such as all logical interfaces mapped to one physical
port), or (iii) the total across every interface. For any aggregate
load value, the report MUST also give the fixed conversion factor that
links the per-interface and multi-interface load values.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>The per-interface value remains the primary unit, consistent
with prevailing practice in <xref target="RFC1242"></xref>, <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC2285"></xref>.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>The last paragraph also applies to other terms related to Load.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<dl>

<t>Definition:</t>

<dl>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>The Trial Forwarding Ratio is a dimensionless floating point value.
It MUST range between 0.0 and 1.0, both inclusive.
It is calculated by dividing the number of frames
successfully forwarded by the SUT
by the total number of frames expected to be forwarded during the trial.</t>
  </dd>
</dl>

<t>Discussion:</t>

<dl>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>For most Traffic Profiles, &quot;expected to be forwarded&quot; means
&quot;intended to get received by SUT from tester&quot;.
This SHOULD be the default interpretation.
Only if this is not the case, the test report MUST describe the Traffic Profile
in a detail sufficient to imply how Trial Forwarding Ratio should be calculated.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>Trial Forwarding Ratio MAY be expressed in other units
(e.g., as a percentage) in the test report.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>Note that, contrary to Load terms, frame counts used to compute
Trial Forwarding Ratio are generally aggregates over all SUT output interfaces,
as most test procedures verify all outgoing frames.
The procedure for <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> Throughput counts received frames,
so implicitly it implies bidirectional counts for bidirectional traffic,
even though the final value is &quot;rate&quot; that is still per-interface.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>For example, in a test with symmetric bidirectional traffic,
if one direction is forwarded without losses, but the opposite direction
does not forward at all, the Trial Forwarding Ratio would be 0.5 (50%).</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>

measured separately, so every interface may report a distinct rate. The
Trial Forwarding Rate, by contrast, uses a single set of frame counts
and therefore yields one value that represents the whole system,
while still preserving the direct link to the per-interface load.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>When the Traffic Profile is symmetric and bidirectional, as defined in
Section 14 of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>, the Trial Forwarding Rate is numerically equal
to the arithmetic average of the individual per-interface forwarding rates
that would be produced by the RFC 2285 procedure.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>For more complex traffic patterns, such as many-to-one as mentioned
in Section 3.3.2 Partially Meshed Traffic of <xref target="RFC2285"></xref>,
the meaning of Trial Forwarding Rate is less straightforward.
For example, if two input interfaces receive one million frames per second each,
and a single interface outputs 1.4 million frames per second (fps),
Trial Load is 1 million fps, Trial Loss Ratio is 30%,
and Trial Forwarding Rate is 0.7 million fps.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>&#160;</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>Because this rate is anchored to the Load defined for one interface,
a test report MAY show it either as the single averaged figure just described,
or as the sum of the separate per-interface forwarding rates.
For the example above, the aggregate trial forwarding rate is 1.4 million fps.</t>

The components were introduced in <xref target="architecture-overview">Architecture Overview</xref>,
and the following subsections finalize their definitions
using terms from previous sections.</t>

<t>Note that the architecture also implies the presence of other components,
such as the SUT and the tester (as a sub-component of the Measurer).</t>

<t>Communication protocols and interfaces between components are left
unspecified. For example, when MLRsearch Specification mentions
&quot;Controller calls Measurer&quot;,
it is possible that the Controller notifies the Manager
to call the Measurer indirectly instead. In doing so, the Measurer implementations
can be fully independent from the Controller implementations,
e.g., developed in different programming languages.</t>

<t>This section discusses compliance relations between MLRsearch
and other test procedures.</t>

<section anchor="test-procedure-compliant-with-mlrsearch"><name>Test Procedure Compliant with MLRsearch</name>

<t>Any networking measurement setup that could be understood as consisting of
functional elements satisfying requirements
for the Measurer, the Controller and the Manager,
is compliant with MLRsearch Specification.</t>

<t>These components can be seen as abstractions present in any testing procedure.
For example, there can be a single component acting both
as the Manager and the Controller, but if values of required attributes
of Search Goals and Goal Results are visible in the test report,
the Controller Input instance and Controller Output instance are implied.</t>

<t>For example, any setup for conditionally (or unconditionally)
compliant <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> throughput testing
can be understood as a MLRsearch architecture,
if there is enough data to reconstruct the Relevant Upper Bound.</t>

<t>Refer to section 
<xref target="mlrsearch-compliant-with-rfc-2544">MLRsearch Compliant with RFC 2544</xref>
for an equivalent Search Goal.</t>

<t>Any test procedure that can be understood as one call to the Manager of
MLRsearch architecture is said to be compliant with MLRsearch Specification.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="mlrsearch-compliant-with-rfc-2544"><name>MLRsearch Compliant with RFC 2544</name>

<t>The following Search Goal instance makes the corresponding Search Result
unconditionally compliant with Section 24 of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Goal Final Trial Duration = 60 seconds</t>
  <t>Goal Duration Sum = 60 seconds</t>
  <t>Goal Loss Ratio = 0%</t>
  <t>Goal Exceed Ratio = 0%</t>
</list></t>

<t>Goal Loss Ratio and Goal Exceed Ratio attributes,
are enough to make the Search Goal conditionally compliant.
Adding Goal Final Trial Duration
makes the Search Goal unconditionally compliant.</t>

<t>Goal Duration Sum prevents MLRsearch
from repeating zero-loss Full-Length Trials.</t>

<t>The presence of other Search Goals does not affect the compliance
of this Goal Result.
The Relevant Lower Bound and the Conditional Throughput are in this case
equal to each other, and the value is the <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> throughput.</t>

<t>Non-zero exceed ratio is not strictly disallowed, but it could
needlessly prolong the search when Low-Loss short trials are present.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="mlrsearch-compliant-with-tst009"><name>MLRsearch Compliant with TST009</name>

<t>One of the alternatives to <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> is Binary search with loss verification
as described in Section 12.3.3 of <xref target="TST009"></xref>.</t>

<t>The rationale of such search is to repeat high-loss trials, hoping for zero loss on second try,
so the results are closer to the noiseless end of performance spectrum,
thus more repeatable and comparable.</t>

<t>Only the variant with &quot;z = infinity&quot; is achievable with MLRsearch.</t>

<t>For example, for &quot;max(r) = 2&quot; variant, the following Search Goal instance
should be used to get a compatible Search Result:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Goal Final Trial Duration = 60 seconds</t>
  <t>Goal Duration Sum = 120 seconds</t>
  <t>Goal Loss Ratio = 0%</t>
  <t>Goal Exceed Ratio = 50%</t>
</list></t>

<t>If the first 60-second trial has zero loss, it is enough for MLRsearch to stop
measuring at that load, as even a second high-loss trial
would still fit within the exceed ratio.</t>

<t>But if the first trial is high-loss, MLRsearch needs to perform also
the second trial to classify that load.
Goal Duration Sum is twice as long as Goal Final Trial Duration,
so third full-length trial is never needed.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="methodology-rationale-and-design-considerations"><name>Methodology Rationale and Design Considerations</name>

<t>This section explains the Why behind MLRsearch. Building on the
normative specification in <xref target="mlrsearch-specification">MLRsearch Specification</xref>,
it contrasts MLRsearch with the classic
<xref target="RFC2544"></xref> single-ratio <xref target="plain-bisect">Plain Bisect</xref> and walks through the
key design choices: binary-search mechanics, stopping-rule precision,
loss-inversion for multiple goals, exceed-ratio handling, short-trial
strategies, and the generalised throughput concept. Together, these
considerations show how the methodology reduces test time, supports
multiple loss ratios, and improves repeatability.</t>

<section anchor="binary-search"><name>Binary Search</name>

<t>A typical binary search implementation for <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>
such as <xref target="plain-bisect">Plain Bisect</xref>
tracks only the two tightest bounds.
To start, the search needs both Max Load and Min Load values.
Then, one trial is used to confirm Max Load is an Upper Bound,
and one trial to confirm Min Load is a Lower Bound.</t>

<t>Then, next Trial Load is chosen as the mean of the current tightest upper bound
and the current tightest lower bound, and becomes a new tightest bound
depending on the Trial Loss Ratio.</t>

<t>After some number of trials, the tightest lower bound becomes the throughput,
but <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> does not specify when, if ever, the search should stop.
In practice, the search stops either at some distance
between the tightest upper bound and the tightest lower bound,
or after some number of Trials.</t>

<t>For a given pair of Max Load and Min Load values,
there is one-to-one correspondence between number of Trials
and final distance between the tightest bounds.
Thus, the search always takes the same time,
assuming initial bounds are confirmed.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="stopping-conditions-and-precision"><name>Stopping Conditions and Precision</name>

<t>MLRsearch Specification requires listing both Relevant Bounds for each
Search Goal, and the difference between the bounds implies
whether the result precision is achieved.
Therefore, it is not necessary to report the specific stopping condition used.</t>

<t>MLRsearch implementations may use Goal Width
to allow direct control of result precision
and indirect control of the Search Duration.</t>

<t>Other MLRsearch implementations may use different stopping conditions:
for example based on the Search Duration, trading off precision control
for duration control.</t>

<t>Due to various possible time optimizations, there is no strict
correspondence between the Search Duration and Goal Width values.
In practice, noisy SUT performance increases both average search time
and its variance.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="loss-ratios-and-loss-inversion"><name>Loss Ratios and Loss Inversion</name>

<t>The biggest difference between MLRsearch and [RFC2544] <xref target="plain-bisect">Plain Bisect</xref>
is in the goals of the search.
<xref target="RFC2544"></xref> has a single goal, based on classifying a single full-length trial
as either zero-loss or non-zero-loss.
MLRsearch supports searching for multiple Search Goals at once,
usually differing in their Goal Loss Ratio values.</t>

<section anchor="single-goal-and-hard-bounds"><name>Single Goal and Hard Bounds</name>

<t>Each bound in <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> plain bisect is &quot;hard&quot;,
in the sense that all further Trial Load values
are smaller than any current upper bound and larger than any current lower bound.</t>

<t>This is also possible for MLRsearch implementations,
when the search is started with only one Search Goal instance.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="multiple-goals-and-loss-inversion"><name>Multiple Goals and Loss Inversion</name>

<t>MLRsearch Specification supports multiple Search Goals, making the search procedure
more complicated compared to binary search with single goal,
but most of the complications do not affect the final results much.
Except for one phenomenon: Loss Inversion.</t>

<t>Depending on Search Goal attributes, Load Classification results may be resistant
to small amounts of <xref target="inconsistent-trial-results">Inconsistent Trial Results</xref>.
However, for larger amounts, a Load that is classified
as an Upper Bound for one Search Goal
may still be a Lower Bound for another Search Goal.
Due to this other goal, MLRsearch will probably perform subsequent Trials
at Trial Loads even larger than the original value.</t>

<t>This introduces questions any many-goals search algorithm has to address.
For example: What to do when all such larger load trials happen to have zero loss?
Does it mean the earlier upper bound was not real?
Does it mean the later Low-Loss trials are not considered a lower bound?</t>

<t>The situation where a smaller Load is classified as an Upper Bound,
while a larger Load is classified as a Lower Bound (for the same search goal),
is called Loss Inversion.</t>

<t>Conversely, only single-goal search algorithms can have hard bounds
that shield them from Loss Inversion.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="conservativeness-and-relevant-bounds"><name>Conservativeness and Relevant Bounds</name>

<t>MLRsearch is conservative when dealing with Loss Inversion:
the Upper Bound is considered real, and the Lower Bound
is considered to be a fluke, at least when computing the final result.</t>

<t>This is formalized using definitions of
<xref target="relevant-upper-bound">Relevant Upper Bound</xref> and
<xref target="relevant-lower-bound">Relevant Lower Bound</xref>.</t>

<t>The Relevant Upper Bound (for specific goal) is the smallest Load classified
as an Upper Bound. But the Relevant Lower Bound is not simply
the largest among Lower Bounds. It is the largest Load among Loads
that are Lower Bounds while also being smaller than the Relevant Upper Bound.</t>

<t>With these definitions, the Relevant Lower Bound is always smaller
than the Relevant Upper Bound (if both exist), and the two relevant bounds
are used analogously as the two tightest bounds in the binary search.
When they meet the stopping conditions, the Relevant Bounds are used in the output.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="consequences"><name>Consequences</name>

<t>The consequence of the way the Relevant Bounds are defined is that
every Trial Result can have an impact
on any current Relevant Bound larger than that Trial Load,
namely by becoming a new Upper Bound.</t>

<t>This also applies when that Load is measured
before another Load gets enough measurements to become a current Relevant Bound.</t>

<t>This also implies that if the SUT tested (or the Traffic Generator used)
needs a warm-up, it should be warmed up before starting the Search,
otherwise the first few measurements could become unjustly limiting.</t>

<t>For MLRsearch implementations, it means it is better to measure
at smaller Loads first, so bounds found earlier are less likely
to get invalidated later.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="exceed-ratio-and-multiple-trials"><name>Exceed Ratio and Multiple Trials</name>

<t>The idea of performing multiple Trials at the same Trial Load comes from
a model where some Trial Results (those with high Trial Loss Ratio) are affected
by infrequent effects, causing unsatisfactory repeatability</t>

<t>of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> Throughput results. Refer to Section <xref target="dut-in-sut">DUT in SUT</xref>
for a discussion about noiseful and noiseless ends
of the SUT performance spectrum.
Stable results are closer to the noiseless end of the SUT performance spectrum,
so MLRsearch may need to allow some frequency of high-loss trials
to ignore the rare but big effects near the noiseful end.</t>

<t>For MLRsearch to perform such Trial Result filtering, it needs
a configuration option to tell how frequent the &quot;infrequent&quot; big loss can be.
This option is called the <xref target="goal-exceed-ratio">Goal Exceed Ratio</xref>.
It tells MLRsearch what ratio of trials (more specifically,
what ratio of Trial Effective Duration seconds)
can have a <xref target="trial-loss-ratio">Trial Loss Ratio</xref>
larger than the <xref target="goal-loss-ratio">Goal Loss Ratio</xref>
and still be classified as a <xref target="lower-bound">Lower Bound</xref>.</t>

<t>Zero exceed ratio means all Trials must have a Trial Loss Ratio
equal to or lower than the Goal Loss Ratio.</t>

<t>When more than one Trial is intended to classify a Load,
MLRsearch also needs something that controls the number of trials needed.
Therefore, each goal also has an attribute called Goal Duration Sum.</t>

<t>The meaning of a <xref target="goal-duration-sum">Goal Duration Sum</xref> is that
when a Load has (Full-Length) Trials
whose Trial Effective Durations when summed up give a value at least as big
as the Goal Duration Sum value,
the Load is guaranteed to be classified either as an Upper Bound
or a Lower Bound for that Search Goal instance.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="short-trials-and-duration-selection"><name>Short Trials and Duration Selection</name>

<t>MLRsearch requires each Search Goal to specify its Goal Final Trial Duration.</t>

<t>Section 24 of <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> already anticipates possible time savings
when Short Trials are used.</t>

<t>An MLRsearch implementation MAY expose configuration parameters that
decide whether, when, and how short trial durations are used. The exact
heuristics and controls are left to the discretion of the implementer.</t>

<t>While MLRsearch implementations are free to use any logic to select
Trial Input values, comparability between MLRsearch implementations
is only assured when the Load Classification logic
handles any possible set of Trial Results in the same way.</t>

<t>The presence of Short Trial Results complicates
the Load Classification logic, see more details in Section
<xref target="load-classification-logic">Load Classification Logic</xref>.</t>

<t>While the Load Classification algorithm is designed to avoid any unneeded Trials,
for explainability reasons it is recommended for users to use
such Controller Input instances that lead to all Trial Duration values
selected by Controller to be the same,
e.g., by setting any Goal Initial Trial Duration to be a single value
also used in all Goal Final Trial Duration attributes.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="generalized-throughput"><name>Generalized Throughput</name>

<t>Because testing equipment takes the Intended Load
as an input parameter for a Trial measurement,
any load search algorithm needs to deal with Intended Load values internally.</t>

<t>But in the presence of Search Goals with a non-zero
<xref target="goal-loss-ratio">Goal Loss Ratio</xref>, the Load usually does not match
the user&#39;s intuition of what a throughput is.
The forwarding rate as defined in Section Section 3.6.1 of <xref target="RFC2285"></xref> is better,
but it is not obvious how to generalize it
for Loads with multiple Trials and a non-zero Goal Loss Ratio.</t>

<t>The clearest illustration - and the chief reason for adopting a
generalized throughput definition - is the presence of a hard
performance limit.</t>

<section anchor="hard-performance-limit"><name>Hard Performance Limit</name>

<t>Even if bandwidth of a medium allows higher traffic forwarding performance,
the SUT interfaces may have their additional own limitations,
e.g., a specific frames-per-second limit on the NIC (a common occurrence).</t>

<t>Those limitations should be known and provided as Max Load, Section
<xref target="max-load">Max Load</xref>.</t>

<t>But if Max Load is set larger than what the interface can receive or transmit,
there will be a &quot;hard limit&quot; behavior observed in Trial Results.</t>

<t>Consider that the hard limit is at hundred million frames per second (100 Mfps),
Max Load is larger, and the Goal Loss Ratio is 0.5%.
If DUT has no additional losses, 0.5% Trial Loss Ratio will be achieved
at Relevant Lower Bound of 100.5025 Mfps.</t>

<t>Reporting a throughput that exceeds the SUT&#39;s verified hard limit is
counter-intuitive. Accordingly, the <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> Throughput metric should
be generalized - rather than relying solely on the Relevant Lower
Bound - to reflect realistic, limit-aware performance.</t>

<t>MLRsearch defines one such generalization,
the <xref target="conditional-throughput">Conditional Throughput</xref>.
It is the Trial Forwarding Rate from one of the Full-Length Trials
performed at the Relevant Lower Bound.
The algorithm to determine which trial exactly is in
<xref target="conditional-throughput-code">conditional throughput code</xref>.</t>

<t>In the hard limit example, 100.5025 Mfps Load will still have
only 100.0 Mfps forwarding rate, nicely confirming the known limitation.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="performance-variability"><name>Performance Variability</name>

<t>With non-zero Goal Loss Ratio, and without hard performance limits,
Low-Loss trials at the same Load may achieve different Trial Forwarding Rate
values just due to DUT performance variability.</t>

<t>By comparing the best case (all Relevant Lower Bound trials have zero loss)
and the worst case (all Trial Loss Ratios at Relevant Lower Bound
are equal to the Goal Loss Ratio),
one can prove that Conditional Throughput
values may have up to the Goal Loss Ratio relative difference.</t>

<t>Setting the Goal Width below the Goal Loss Ratio
may cause the Conditional Throughput for a larger Goal Loss Ratio to become smaller
than a Conditional Throughput for a goal with a lower Goal Loss Ratio,
which is counter-intuitive, considering they come from the same Search.
Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED to set the Goal Width to a value no lower
than the Goal Loss Ratio of the higher-loss Search Goal.</t>

<t>Although Conditional Throughput can fluctuate from one run to the next,
it still offers a more discriminating basis for comparison than the
Relevant Lower Bound - particularly when deterministic load selection
yields the same Lower Bound value across multiple runs.</t>

<section anchor="mlrsearch-logic-and-example"><name>MLRsearch Logic and Example</name>

<t>This section uses informal language to describe two aspects of MLRsearch logic:
Load Classification and Conditional Throughput,
reflecting formal pseudocode representation provided in
<xref target="load-classification-code">load classification code</xref>
and <xref target="conditional-throughput-code">conditional throughput code</xref>.
This is followed by example search.</t>

<t>The logic is equivalent but not identical to the pseudocode
on appendices. The pseudocode is designed to be short and frequently
combines multiple operations into one expression.
The logic as described in this section lists each operation separately
and uses more intuitive names for the intermediate values.</t>

<section anchor="sut-behaviors"><name>SUT Behaviors</name>

<t>In Section <xref target="dut-in-sut">DUT in SUT</xref>, the notion of noise has been introduced.
This section uses new terms
to describe possible SUT behaviors more precisely.</t>

<t>From measurement point of view, noise is visible as inconsistent trial results.
See <xref target="inconsistent-trial-results">Inconsistent Trial Results</xref> for general points
and <xref target="loss-ratios-and-loss-inversion">Loss Ratios and Loss Inversion</xref>
for specifics when comparing different Load values.</t>

<t>Load Classification and Conditional Throughput apply to a single Load value,
but even the set of Trial Results measured at that Trial Load value
may appear inconsistent.</t>

<t>As MLRsearch aims to save time, it executes only a small number of Trials,
getting only a limited amount of information about SUT behavior.
It is useful to introduce an &quot;SUT expert&quot; point of view to contrast
with that limited information.</t>

<section anchor="expert-predictions"><name>Expert Predictions</name>

<t>Imagine that before the Search starts, a human expert had unlimited time
to measure SUT and obtain all reliable information about it.
The information is not perfect, as there is still random noise influencing SUT.
But the expert is familiar with possible noise events, even the rare ones,
and thus the expert can do probabilistic predictions about future Trial Outputs.</t>

<t>When several outcomes are possible,
the expert can assess probability of each outcome.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="exceed-probability"><name>Exceed Probability</name>

<t>When the Controller selects new Trial Duration and Trial Load,
and just before the Measurer starts performing the Trial,
the SUT expert can envision possible Trial Results.</t>

<t>With respect to a particular Search Goal instance, the possibilities
can be summarized into a single number: Exceed Probability.
It is the probability (according to the expert) that the measured
Trial Loss Ratio will be higher than the Goal Loss Ratio.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="trial-duration-dependence"><name>Trial Duration Dependence</name>

<t>When comparing Exceed Probability values for the same Trial Load value
but different Trial Duration values,
there are several patterns that commonly occur in practice.</t>

<section anchor="strong-increase"><name>Strong Increase</name>

<t>Exceed Probability is very low at short durations but very high at full-length.
This SUT behavior is undesirable, and may hint at faulty SUT,
e.g., SUT leaks resources and is unable to sustain the desired performance.</t>

<t>But this behavior is also seen when SUT uses large amount of buffers.
This is the main reasons users may want to set large Goal Final Trial Duration.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="mild-increase"><name>Mild Increase</name>

<t>Short trials are slightly less likely to exceed the loss-ratio limit,
but the improvement is modest. This mild benefit is typical when noise
is dominated by rare, large loss spikes: during a full-length trial,
the good-performing periods cannot fully offset the heavy frame loss
that occurs in the brief low-performing bursts.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="independence"><name>Independence</name>

<t>Short trials have basically the same Exceed Probability as full-length trials.
This is possible only if loss spikes are small (so other parts can compensate)
and if Goal Loss Ratio is more than zero (otherwise, other parts
cannot compensate at all).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="decrease"><name>Decrease</name>

<t>Short trials have larger Exceed Probability than full-length trials.
This can be possible only for non-zero Goal Loss Ratio,
for example if SUT needs to &quot;warm up&quot; to best performance within each trial.
Not commonly seen in practice.</t>

<t>Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
technology characterization of a DUT/SUT using controlled stimuli in a

<t>Further, benchmarking is performed on an &quot;opaque&quot; basis, relying

<t>The DUT/SUT SHOULD NOT include features that serve only to boost
benchmark scores - such as a dedicated &quot;fast-track&quot; test mode that is
never used in normal operation.</t>

<t>Any implications for network security arising from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be
identical in the lab and in production networks.</t>

<section anchor="load-classification-code"><name>Load Classification Code</name>

<t>This appendix specifies how to perform the Load Classification.</t>

<t>Any Trial Load value can be classified,
according to a given <xref target="search-goal">Search Goal</xref> instance.</t>

<t>The algorithm uses (some subsets of) the set of all available Trial Results
from Trials measured at a given Load at the end of the Search.</t>

<t>The block at the end of this appendix holds pseudocode
which computes two values, stored in variables named
<spanx style="verb">optimistic_is_lower</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">pessimistic_is_lower</spanx>.</t>

<t>Although presented as pseudocode, the listing is syntactically valid
Python and can be executed without modification.</t>

<t>If values of both variables are computed to be true, the Load in question
is classified as a Lower Bound according to the given Search Goal instance.
If values of both variables are false, the Load is classified as an Upper Bound.
Otherwise, the load is classified as Undecided.</t>

<t>Some variable names are shortened to fit expressions in one line.
Namely, variables holding sum quantities end in <spanx style="verb">_s</spanx> instead of <spanx style="verb">_sum</spanx>,
and variables holding effective quantities start in <spanx style="verb">effect_</spanx>
instead of <spanx style="verb">effective_</spanx>.</t>

<t>The pseudocode expects the following variables to hold the following values:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="verb">goal_duration_s</spanx>: The Goal Duration Sum value of the given Search Goal.</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">goal_exceed_ratio</spanx>: The Goal Exceed Ratio value of the given Search Goal.</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">full_length_low_loss_s</spanx>: Sum of Trial Effective Durations across Trials
with Trial Duration at least equal to the Goal Final Trial Duration

  <t><spanx style="verb">full_length_high_loss_s</spanx>: Sum of Trial Effective Durations across Trials
with Trial Duration at least equal to the Goal Final Trial Duration

with Trial Duration shorter than the Goal Final Trial Duration
and with Trial Loss Ratio higher than the Goal Loss Ratio
(across Short High-Loss Trials).</t>

<t>The code works correctly also when there are no Trial Results at a given Load.</t>

<section anchor="example-search"><name>Example Search</name>

<t>The following example Search is related to
one hypothetical run of a Search test procedure
that has been started with multiple Search Goals.
Several points in time are chosen, to show how the logic works,
with specific sets of Trial Result available.
The trial results themselves are not very realistic, as
the intention is to show several corner cases of the logic.</t>

<t>In all Trials, the Effective Trial Duration is equal to Trial Duration.</t>

<t>Only one Trial Load is in focus, its value is one million frames per second.
Trial Results at other Trial Loads are not mentioned,
as the parts of logic present here do not depend on those.
In practice, Trial Results at other Load values would be present,
e.g., MLRsearch will look for a Lower Bound smaller than any Upper Bound found.</t>

<t>At any given moment, exactly one Search Goal is designated as in focus.
This designation affects only the Trial Duration chosen for new trials;
it does not alter the rest of the decision logic.</t>

<t>An MLRsearch implementation is free to evaluate several goals
simultaneously - the &quot;focus&quot; mechanism is optional and appears here only
to show that a load can still be classified against goals that are not
currently in focus.</t>

<section anchor="example-goals"><name>Example Goals</name>

<t>The following four Search Goal instances are selected for the example Search.
Each goal has a readable name and dense code,
the code is useful to show Search Goal attribute values.</t>

<t>As the variable &quot;exceed coefficient&quot; does not depend on trial results,
it is also precomputed here.</t>

<t>Goal 1:</t>

the other two cover less frequent cases.</t>

<section anchor="example-trial-results"><name>Example Trial Results</name>

<t>The following six sets of trial results are selected for the example Search.
The sets are defined as points in time, describing which Trial Results

the code is useful to show Trial Output attribute values
and number of times identical results were added.</t>

<t>Comments on point in time naming:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>When a name contains &quot;short&quot;, it means the added trial
had Trial Duration of 1 second, which is Short Trial for 3 of the Search Goals,
but it is a Full-Length Trial for the &quot;1s final&quot; goal.</t>
  <t>Similarly, &quot;long&quot; in name means the added trial
had Trial Duration of 60 seconds, which is Full-Length Trial for 3 goals
but Long Trial for the &quot;1s final&quot; goal.</t>
  <t>When a name contains &quot;good&quot; it means the added trial is Low-Loss Trial
for all the goals.</t>
  <t>When a name contains &quot;short bad&quot; it means the added trial is High-Loss Trial
for all the goals.</t>
  <t>When a name contains &quot;long bad&quot;, it means the added trial
is a High-Loss Trial for goals &quot;RFC2544&quot; and &quot;TST009&quot;,
but it is a Low-Loss Trial for the two other goals.</t>

<t>Due to zero Goal Loss Ratio, RFC2544 goal must have mild or strong increase
of exceed probability, so the one lossy trial would be lossy even if measured
at 60 second duration.
Due to zero exceed ratio, one High-Loss Trial is enough to preclude this Load
from becoming a Lower Bound for RFC2544. That is why this Load
is classified as an Upper Bound for RFC2544 this early.</t>

<t>This is an example how significant time can be saved, compared to 60-second trials.</t>

<t>As designed for TST009 goal, one Full-Length High-Loss Trial can be tolerated.
120s worth of 1-second trials is not useful, as this is allowed when
Exceed Probability does not depend on Trial Duration.
As Goal Loss Ratio is zero, it is not possible for 60-second trials
to compensate for losses seen in 1-second results.
But Load Classification logic does not have that knowledge hardcoded,
so optimistic exceed ratio is still only 50%.</t>

<t>But the 0.1% Trial Loss Ratio is lower than &quot;20% exceed&quot; Goal Loss Ratio,
so this unexpected Full-Length Low-Loss trial changed the classification result
of this Load to Lower Bound.</t>

<t>This is the Low-Loss Trial the &quot;TST009&quot; goal was waiting for.
This Load is now classified for all goals; the search may end.
Or, more realistically, it can focus on larger load only,
as the three goals will want an Upper Bound (unless this Load is Max Load).</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="conditional-throughput-computations"><name>Conditional Throughput Computations</name>

<t>At the end of this hypothetical search, the &quot;RFC2544&quot; goal labels the
load as an Upper Bound, making it ineligible for Conditional-Throughput
calculations. By contrast, the other three goals treat the same load as
a Lower Bound; if it is also accepted as their Relevant Lower Bound,
Conditional Throughput values can be computed for each of them.</t>

<t>(The load under discussion is 1 000 000 frames per second.)</t>

<section anchor="goal-2"><name>Goal 2</name>

<t>The Conditional Throughput is computed from sorted list
of Full-Length Trial results. As TST009 Goal Final Trial Duration is 60 seconds,
only two of 122 Trials are considered Full-Length Trials.
One has Trial Loss Ratio of 0%, the other of 0.1%.</t>

<t>The Conditional Throughput is computed from sorted list

  <t>Conditional Throughput is the current forwarding ratio multiplied by the Load value.</t>
  <t>Conditional Throughput is 999 thousand frames per second.</t>
