Hi Jen,

Thank you for your review!

It was quite detailed, unfortunately we did not have enough time
to address all the comments properly (considering Maciek is on PTO).

Still, I decided an incomplete response is better than no response,
so I quickly uploaded version 13 of our draft, edits are visible here:
https://author-tools.ietf.org/iddiff?url1=draft-ietf-bmwg-mlrsearch-12&url2=draft-ietf-bmwg-mlrsearch-13&difftype=--html

Ok, second paragraph of section 1.1 edited,
"Section 12.3.2 of [TST009]" instead of "[TST009] and [RFC2544]".

This is one of weak points of the current text.
We sometimes add forward references to sections of the documents,
but sometimes we rely on capitalization only.
Adding references to first occurrence could be a good compromise.
Specifically for Search Goal, I added a reference,
but somehow put the plural "s" in a wrong place.
Not sure whether uploading next draft version just to fix that is worth it.

> Also, I feel like Section 1.2 kind of overlaps with 4.1

That is intentional.
4.1 is normative core (belongs to specification),
1.2 is broader context (belongs to introduction).
Maybe the last paragraph of 1.2 could be shortened,
especially since it mentions Search Goal (but so does previous paragraph).

I agree both subsections can be improved to reduce unnecessary overlap,
but I was not able to arrive at better text for now.

> 2. Add a Terminology section right after the introduction

We tried to do that in earlier revisions, but it did not work well.
We have some text at the start of section 4,
but apparently it is still not strong enough for readers
to realize our terminology setup.

For the last version, I added a paragraph to section 1 (Introduction),
but I am not sure it is enough.

> Introduction:
> "Be careful when dealing with inconsistent trial results"

Replaced with:
"Process of inconsistent trial results carefully."
Once again, I missed the "of" now should not be there.

> "Reported throughput is smaller than the smallest load with high loss."

Replaced with:
"Reported throughput should be smaller than the smallest load with high loss."

> "MLRsearch configuration supports both conservative settings and aggressive
> settings. Conservative enough settings lead to results unconditionally
> compliant with [RFC2544],"

Replaced with:
"MLRsearch configuration supports both conservative settings and
aggressive settings. Results unconditionally compliant with
[RFC2544] are possible with conservative enough settings,"

> Section 2.2
> Would be nice to expland SUT acronym upon its first use in the text, not later.

Fixed by moving the paragraph starting with "Section 19 of [RFC2544]"
before the RFC2285 definitions.

> Section 2.4
> The last bullet point in the "Motivations are many:" list shouldn't actually be
> a  bullet point, as it's not "one of many".

Yes, changed from a list item into an ordinary paragraph.

> "Regardless of the validity of all similar motivations, support for non-zero
> loss goals makes a search algorithm more user-friendly. [RFC2544] throughput is

I agree the text is not good, but I was unable to really improve.

The story is that the motivations explain why some "users"
(people deciding which benchmarks are measured,
a term we removed from earlier revisions, instead of trying to define properly)
may want to use non-zero loss ratio as part of their search goals,
but most search algorithm implementations based on RFC2544
do not offer such configuration options.
A search algorithm is "user-friendly" for such users if it offers the configuration option,
and this usefulness depends just on user's decision,
not on (regardless of) which motivation explains that decision.

Yes, "loss" inserted.

> Also, IMHO, it

> ration - depending on the specific upper-layer protocol and the application.

I agree, but once again I was not able to find a good edit.
Especially since some reviewers (hi Med) like to ask for references
for any overarching conclusion (which protocol? which app?) like that.

The [Lencze-Shima] reference goes deeper into some of intricacies,
but it also does not attempt to give suggestions for specific protocols and apps.

> Section 4.2

Section 4.2 is already full of capitalized phrases,
each could warrant a section reference.
Maybe adding a reminder about our usage of capitalized phrases could help,
But I was not sure so I did not make any edits there.

> "Depending on Search Goal attributes, Load Classification results may be
> resistant to small amounts of Section Inconsistent Trial Results (Section
> 2.5)."

Yes, deleted the first Section occurrence.

> There are a number of places where a new paragraph starts in the middle of the sentence,

All of those should have been fixed in draft version 12.

Many thanks again for your review â€“ appreciate!

Vratko and Maciek (authors).
