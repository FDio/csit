Hi Eric, thanks for the review!

In the meantime, we got reviews from other people,
our edits are visible here: [1] (rendered diff) and [2] (source).

!!!

I guess the intent of the offending sentence is to say that those CPUs
are commonly used, but their performance is less predictable.
The I-D is applicable to all SUTs, but the purpose-built ones
tend to be predictable enough for existing RFC2544 throughput to be stable.
Not sure how to improve that sentence, deferring to Maciek.

I agree, but I would need more time to do that properly.

> Is `MLRsearch Specification` valid in an informational I-D ?

I am not sure.
Most of section 1.2 is decribing how BMWG documents
are informational "de iure" but normative "de facto".
MLRsearch Specification is normative in this "de facto" way,
(most of) the rest of the document remains informative also de facto.
No idea what we should state "de iure".

Another disconnect between IETF and BMWG?
For example, Section 5 of RFC 2544 contains this sentence:
"An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more
of the MUST requirements for the protocols it implements."

> ### Section 2.1

No? It should be a consequence of how "vanilla bisect" works.
One trial is enough to halve the interval between current lower and upper bound.
The offending sentence can be revisited once description of bisect is improved
as per the comment above.

> ### Section 2.2

Probably a good idea.
Not enough time for me to invent a better title.

We have subsection 4.10.1. Test Procedure Compliant with MLRsearch,
so compliance is what we want to define.
See my previous reply on how I have no idea whether that can be done "de iure" in this case.

I guess some sections describe, some specify.
Previous points need to be decided before we can start cleaning up the language.

> ### Section 4.1.3
>

Again, we need to decide what can be "normative" in this document.

Direct case (calls only):
Manager ---(one)--> Controller ---(many)--> Measurer.

Indiect case (requests and responses):
                                 +---------+                          +------------+
+----------+                     | Manager | ---(Controller Input)--> | Controller |
| Measurer | <--(Trial Input)--- |         |   <--(Trial Input)---    |            |
|          | ---(Trial Output)-> |         |   ---(Trial Output)->    |            |
|          | <--(Trial Input)--- |         |   <--(Trial Input)---    |            |
|          | ---(Trial Output)-> |         |   ---(Trial Output)->    |            |
|          | ...                 |         |   ...                    |            |
+----------+                     |         | <--(Controller Output)-- |            |
                                 +---------+                          +------------+

Not sure the direct case adds much,
and I am not looking forward to (prettifying and) implementing
the indirect case in kramdown.

RFC 2544 did that.

Replaced by: "Conditional Throughput values can be computed".
