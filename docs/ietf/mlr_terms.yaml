    description: '
        The code uses "rounding" to convert from float values (load or width)

    description: '
        A helper object used to perform rounding computations.

        integer values is not very high in practice.

    description: '
        A central place where trial results are added,
        and load stats for all targets are tracked,

        Selectors rely only on those relevant bounds
        (as opposed to individual classification results).

-   alternatives:

    - load stat?
    description: '
        Database tracks "full stats", e.g. for a load it can classify
        according to all generated targets.
        But when queried, database responds to a single target
        so only stats for classifying that target are useful in debugging.
        Once again, perhaps too low level.
        But visible in MLRsearch return object, so needs a name in docstrings.
