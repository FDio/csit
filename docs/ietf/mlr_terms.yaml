    tags:
    - essential
    description: "
        General quantity is a quantity that may appear multiple times
        in MLRsearch specification, perhaps each time in a different role.
        The quantity when appearing in a single role is called
        a specific quantity. It is useful to define the general quantity,
        so definitions of specific quantities may refer to it.
        We say a specific quantity is based on a general quantity,
        if the specific quantity definition refers to and
        relies on the general quantity definition.

        It is natural to name specific quantities by adding an adjective
        to the name of the general quantity.
        But existing RFCs typically explicitly define a term acting
        in a specific role, so the RFC name directly refers to a specific
        quantity, while the corresponding general quantity
        is defined only implicitly.
        Therefore this documents defines general quantities explicitly,
        even if the same term already appears in an RFC.

        In practice, it is required to know which unit of measurement
        is used to accompany a numeric value of each quantity.
        The choice of a particular unit of measurement is not important
        for MLRsearch specification though, so specific units
        mentioned in this document are just examples or recommendations,
        not requirements.

        When reporting, it is REQUIRED to state the units used.

        MLRsearch specification frequently groups multiple specific quantities

        to motivations why this or other terms are defined as they are.
        Such insight will be harder to communicate
        with the specific quantities alone.

        Also, it simplifies naming of specific quantities, as they usually can
        share a noun or adjective referring to their common composite.
        Most of relations between composites and specific quantities
        can be described using plain English.

        Perhaps the only exception involves referring to specific quantities
        as attributes. For example if there is a composite called 'target',
        and one of its specific quantities is 'target width' defined using
        a general quantity 'width', we can say 'width is one of target attributes'.

        so we can talk about unidirectional load also
        when bidirectional or multi-port traffic is applied.

        MLRsearch does not rely on this distinction, it works also if
        the load values correspond to aggregate rate
        (sum over all SUT tested input or output interface unidirectional loads),
        as long as all loads share the same semantics.

    description: "
        General quantity defined for an ordered pair (lower and higher)
        of load values, which describes a distance between the two values.

        The motivation for the name comes from binary search.
        The binary search tries to approximate an unknown value
        by repeatedly bisecting an interval of possible values,
        until the interval becomes narrow enough.
        Width of the interval is a specific quantity
        and the termination condition compares that
        to another specific quantity acting as the threshold.
        The threshold value does not have a specific interval associated,
        but corresponds to a 'size' of the compared interval.
        As size is a word already used in definition of frame size,
        a more natural word describing interval is width.

        The MLRsearch specification does use (analogues of) upper bound
        and lower bound, but does not actually need to talk about intervals.
        Still, the intervals are implicitly there, so width is the natural name.

        Actually, there are two popular options for defining width.
        Absolute width is based on load, the value is the higher load
        minus the lower load.
        Relative width is dimensionless, the value is the absolute width
        divided by the higher load. As intended loads for trials are positive,
        relative width is between 0.0 and 1.0 (both including).

        Relative width as a threshold value may be useful for users
        who do not presume what is the typical performance of SUT,
        but absolute width may be a more familiar concept.
        MLRsearch specification does not prescribe which width has to be used,
        but widths MUST be either all absolute or all relative,
        and it MUST be clear from report which option was used
        (it is implied from the unit of measurement of any width value).
