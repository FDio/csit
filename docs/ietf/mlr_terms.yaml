        Useful especially for short phrases that can fit different terms.
        May be missing entirely for self-eplanatory terms.
        Essential terms should have description defining them precisely.
        Other terms can have brief or even empty description.

        _ in any field means the source does not have any phrase for the term.
        Part of phrase in parens gives context (usually using other phrases).
