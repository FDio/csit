There is a new Python implementation,
https://gerrit.fd.io/r/c/csit/+/36061
(marked as abandoned only while waiting for upgraded tooling)
it includes multiple logic updates.

Highlights:

+ Brand new APIs and more standardized terminology.
  Example: "zero loss load" instead of "NDR" or "throughput".

+ Trial durations in inner cycle, loss ratios in outer cycle.
  This means search for zero loss load (at final trial duration)
  completes before search for non-zero loss load starts
  (with initial trial duration).

+ Each loss ratio can have different width goal.

+ In uneven splits, the lower subinterval is the narrower one.

+ Additional ways to prevent wastefully narrow intervals.

+ Do as much math in integers as possible (to prevent rounding errors).
  The previous way of "conservative rounding" cannot work
  across more than one level of trial duration.


There is no new draft version yet.
Reasons are both practical and theoretical.

Practical reasons come mainly from more complicated logic.
Even though the actual Python coded is now more modular and readable
compared to the previous version, the logic itself is more tightly coupled,
thus it is harder to describe its abstractions.
For example, a search phase focusing on one loss ratio goals
has to be able to handle correctly surprising trial outcomes
from a phase focused on another loss ratio goal.

Theoretical reasons come from discrepancies (or at least grey areas)
in RFC 1242 and RFC 2544. So let me talk about those in some detail here.

The grey areas are related to a possibility of "loss inversion".
This is a phenomenon when a trial conducted at a higher load
has zero frame loss, but a trial conducted at a lower load
has a non-zero frame loss.

This is never seen when looking only at trial outcomes
of one throuput search that uses simple bisection.

RFC 2544 formulations such as "the rate of the offered stream is reduced"
are perhaps aimed to prevent this phenomenon,
but onle stronger phrases like "all subsequent rates of the offered stream
shall be below" would achieve that goal.
The fact that MLRsearch can search for multiple loss ratio goals
means some trial outcomes can satisfy one ratio but not another,
so loss inversion cannot be prevented by limitin all subsequent loads.

The problematic occurences of loss inversion are those
where the larger load zero loss outcome happened at final duration.
The two sub-types of loss inversion are distinguished by the other trial
being done (or not) at the final trial duration.

The RFC 1242 definition of throughput is:
  The maximum rate at which none of the offered frames are dropped by the device.

It is not clear if "are dropped" means "are always dropped" or "could be dropped"
(and maximum is over possible trial outcomes), or if the maximum is only
over the actually observed outcomes (either all, or only those that
do not have smaller load with non-zero loss).

RFC 2544 is more specific:
   The throughput is the fastest rate at which the count of test frames
   transmitted by the DUT is equal to the number of test frames sent to
   it by the test equipment.

That would mean maximizing over observed outcomes, and in case of loss inversion
the higher load should be returned. MLRsearch instead searches
below the smaller load.

RFC 2544 mentions "final determination" when mentioning shorter trial duration,
but perhaps non-zero loss at smaller duration implies if the duration
would be longer, the loss would still be non-zero.
