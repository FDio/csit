Hi Jen.

In the meantime, we got reviews from other people,
our edits are visible here: [1] (rendered diff) and [2] (source).

Done.
The second typo got replaced by a better sentence.

Med considered "flexible" to be a too vague word in his review.

I combined the start from our text with the end of your text:
"Regardless of the validity of all similar motivations,
support for non-zero loss goals makes a
search algorithm applicable for a wider range of use cases
than the approach defined in [RFC2544]."
