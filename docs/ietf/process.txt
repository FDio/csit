Commands to convert RFC text from .md (so I do not need to search next time).

Hints:
+ https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/kramdown-rfc2629/
+ https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc
+ https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/FAQ-xml2rfcv3.html

Initial:
$ sudo aptitude install ruby-rubygems
$ sudo gem install kramdown-rfc
$ kdrfc --version

Main:
$ kdrfc draft-ietf-bmwg-mlrsearch-11.md

If that complains, do it manually at https://author-tools.ietf.org/

Finally:
https://author-tools.ietf.org/idnits
