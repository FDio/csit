Outstanding important TODOs:

 1. 354:    TODO: Either say the list talks about CSIT implementation,
    About out-of-scope optimizations in introduction.

 2. 395:    MK: TODO.
    MB wants a pointer to MLRsearch configuration options.

 3. 407:    MK: TODO.
    "flexible" is too ambiguous for MB.

 4. 424:    MK: TODO.
    MB wants pointers to aggressive settings being good for repeatability.
    Worth adding CSIT NDR+PDR as an example goal set?

 5. 445:    MK: TODO Instead I propose we list one liners explaining the term in
    About list of terms, in progress for MK.

 6. 466:    TODO: Update the subsection above when the subsections below are complete enough
    Review and polish Purpose section, ready to start, probably for MK?

 7. 800:    MK: OK. TODO for the whole document.
    > MB34: Please avoid "we" constructs.

 8. 1153:    VP: TODO: Mentional conditional requirements if not clear from usage.
    In progress for VP.

32. 1162:    VP: TODO: Explain there is no separate list for terminology,

 9. 1267:TODO: Multiple tests in RFC2544, this is about throughput only.
10. 1278:TODO: Multiple traffic profiles (at least frame sizes) in RFC2544, this is about single SUT+profile.
11. 1286:TODO: Repeating the same search is possible, this is about single search.
12. 1294:TODO: Manual processes, automation, implementation as library,...
13. 1302:TODO: Calls/invocations, interfaces.
14. 1310:TODO: Regular end, irregular exit, user abort.
15. 1319:TODO: Load classification equivalence (not here, just in later chapters).
16. 1327:TODO: General discussion around test, search, trial and recurrence? For example throughput search can be a part of B2B tests.

17. 1799:    VP: TODO: Contruct appropriate "conditional requirement" sentence.
    In progress VP.

18. 1843:    TODO: Separate short description from further discussion.

19. 1870:    VP: TODO: Mention in Test Case, Test Suite or Test Report.
    > MB64: Does this cover also recurrences?
    Explicitly say Trial is not repeated.

20. 1916:    MK: TODO fix everywhere.
    MB66, about unifying external references into "Section 3.4 of [RFC1242]" pattern.

21. 1987:    VP: TODO: Use normative MAY somewhere.
22. 2779:    VP: TODO: Use MUST NOT to make Controller behavior constrained, conditionally?
23. 2812:    VP: TODO: Use MAY.
24. 2828:    VP: TODO: Use MUST NOT?
25. 2857:    VP: TODO: Use MAY.

27. 3074:    VP: TODO: Use MAY.
28. 3121:    VP: TODO: Use MAY.

29. 2697:          Goal Terms as appropriate. TODO check if more places need this.
    MB88: separate lists of required and optional attributes.

30. 2727:    VP: TODO: Check if new Test_* subsections are good for this discussion.
    MB89: default values for optional attributes.
    May need "user vs implementation" discussion. Can be avoided?

31. 3538:    MK: TODO. This is not a bad idea. A section that in summary table
    MB98: goal instances in table format.

33. 4178:    MK: TODO. Move to Appendix A, before the pseudocode Appendices.
    Turn section Example Search into an appendix. VP prefers after pseudocodes.

34. 4368:    MK: TODO. Kramdown magic.
    Table legend. Currently kramdown creates "Table 1", MB wants "Table 1: XXXX".

35. 4834:    MK: TODO. Disagree. Can we have it in a proper code block instead?
    First Python code block.

36. 4912:    MK: TODO. Not table, it's code. Can we have it in a proper code
    Second Python code block.

37. 4921:    TODO-P2: There are long lines.
