Commands to convert RFC text from .md (so I do not need to search next time).

Hints:

Initial:
$ sudo aptitude install ruby-rubygems
$ sudo gem install kramdown-rfc
$ kdrfc --version

Main:
$ kdrfc draft-ietf-bmwg-mlrsearch-11.md

If that complains, do it manually at https://author-tools.ietf.org/

TODOs:
* #    VP: TODO201: Delete or update or replace the active item.
 Finalize the external reference.

*     TODO202: Either say the list talks about CSIT implementation,
 Just mark out-of-scope optimizations.

*     MK: TODO203. We do not have any section in this document covering
 Aggressive setting. Point to some discussion on noiseless end of performance spectrum.

*     TODO204: Update the subsection above when the subsections below are complete enough.
 Maybe done already, just check.

*     VP: TODO205: Mention conditional requirements if not clear from usage.
 Probably not needed in draft, but mention in e-mail.

*     VP: TODO206: Should we explicitly mention that
 Table of contents instead of terminology list, probably no need to state explicitly.

*     VP: TODO207: Re-check usage of Implementation.
 Hopefully done.

*     VP: TODO208: Downgrade the last sentence from draft to e-mail?
 Currently I prefer "yes".

*     TODO209: Separate short descriptions from further discussions. Everywhere.
 Low priority, I prefer to skip in draft11 cycle.

*     VP: TODO210: Mention the YANG draft as a possible avenue?
 I prefer "yes".

*           Goal Terms as appropriate. TODO211 check if more places need this.
 Low priority this late.

*     VP: TODO212: Re-check.
 The two relevant bounds are special in that they may not exist.
 But I think the surronding text explains that, so I hope this is done.

*     MK: TODO213. This is not a bad idea. A section that in summary table
 Low priority. Doable but hindered by lack of table captions in current kramdown.

*     TODO214: There are long lines.
 Low priority.

*     <mark>VP TODO215 Final Checks. Only mark as done when there are no active todos above.</mark>
 Low priority.

*     <mark>MKP3 VP TODO216: Recheck the definition dependencies go bottom-up.</mark>
 Useful but maybe too late for thorough check.

*     <mark>VP TODO217: Unify external reference style (brackets, spaces, section numbers and names).</mark>
 I think we are done, but we may want to check in .txt render.

*     <mark>MKP2 VP TODO218: Capitalization of New Terms: useful when editing and reviewing,
 Mostly fixed but I bet some mistakes are still present. Low priority.

*     <mark>VP TODO219: If time permits, keep improving formal style (e.g., using AI).</mark>
 No time for that, unless there are confusing sentences.
