Commands to convert RFC text from .md (so I do not need to search next time).

Hints:
+ https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/kramdown-rfc2629/
+ https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc
+ https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/FAQ-xml2rfcv3.html

Initial:
$ sudo aptitude install ruby-rubygems
$ sudo gem install kramdown-rfc
$ kdrfc --version

Main:
$ kdrfc draft-ietf-bmwg-mlrsearch-10.md

If that complains, do it manually at https://author-tools.ietf.org/

Finally:

Now that I have forced the Canvas editor into source-editing style (as opposed to rendered style),
I have real tasks for you, they involve multiple document files.
I am working on an upcoming IETF document, currently still in the draft state.
I have attached two files, one is a markdown source of the document as uploaded recently (draft version 10).
The other attached file is a .doc feedback from AD editor (in e-mails signing as "Med").
The attached markdown file already contains few comments, enclosed between tags `{::comment}` and `{:/comment}`.
The .doc file contains in-place edits proposed by the AD editor, and also Word-specific review-comments from him and my reactions.
I have copied the work-in-progress state of the markdown source into the Canvas editor.
The issue is the whole markdown file is too long for your output tokens limit.
That means everytime I type something into this main chat (Enter a prompt for Gemini) dialog
and you decide to edit something in the Canvas, you spent 20 minutes writing mostly unedited text into Canvas,
during which the Editor is in rendering mode (making your outputs not usable as markdown source yet)
but you run out of tokens, GUI reports "Network error" and I cannot easily make the editor switch back to source-editing mode.
At which point I have to create a new conversation and start over.
So, I would appreciate you not touching the Canvas content, at all.
Even if I tell you otherwise, you should ask for confirmation first.
The other dialog (Ask Gemini), when only a small part of text is selected in Canvas, works only as a pointer.
If you decide to edit the selected area you still attempt to write the whole file and fail.
The current editing phase focuses on copying review-comments from the .doc file into markdown as kramdown-friendly comment blocks.
I already see at least two mistakes, missing or misplaced comment from Med or reply from me (VP).
What is the first mistake you see in the Canvas state compared to .doc review comments?
(You can write the correction to the main chat, but be careful not to touch Canvas content.)



(do not forget to enable canvas)

I have an example markdown source below, including a Python code sub-block. Put that markdown source into Canvas, as a new code immersive with the markdown language type.

### Example subsection

``` python
print("Output text example.")
```

Trailing text example.
