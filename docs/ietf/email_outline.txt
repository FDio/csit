As usual, we ran out of time perfecting the draft.
But as they say, perfect is the enemy of good,
and deadlines are there so the good can win.

Most edits are minor improvements to clarity and general readability.
Some ideas might be of interest to wider BMWG community (not just to MLRsearch document),
but they are still too specific (language usage around security considerations
and around requirements language) to be discussed in this thread.

The only important aspect worth discussing here is "positioning".
We added two new sections:
- 1.2. Positioning within BMWG Methodologies
- 4.1. Scope

It is hard for me to summarize the final text without oversimplifying or going too deep.
In our presentation we want to focus on the positioning in greater detail,
and we may outline the ideas on security considerations and requirements language if time permits.

That exported document helpfully numbered your side comments.
We picked up those into comment blocks in our markdown source file.
If you have specific questions on our edits, you may want to look into
the final version-11 source, github mirror URL is:

For example, if you search for "MB108" (without quotes)
you will find the reason why our tables still do not have proper captions.
