Most edits are minor improvements for clarity and general readability,
including addressing the comments from  AD review by Mohamed Boucadair.

The most important aspect that requires discussion within BMWG
is "positioning".

We added two new sections to this regard:
- 1.2. Positioning within BMWG Methodologies
- 4.1. Scope

We would like to cover the positioning described in both in our
presentation during the next BMWG meeting at IETF 123.

For Med:

> Pdf: https://github.com/boucadair/IETF-Drafts-Reviews/blob/master/2025/draft-ietf-bmwg-mlrsearch-10-rev%20Med.pdf

That exported document helpfully numbered your side comments.
We picked up those into comment blocks in our markdown source file.

If you have specific questions on our edits, you may want to look into
the final version-11 source, github mirror URL is:

For example, if you search for "MB108" (without quotes)
you will find the reason why our tables still do not have proper captions.

One more thing: We did not address your comments to the Security
Considerations section, as we used BMWG standard text applicable to
air-gapped lab benchmarking environments. If this needs to be
revisited, we will welcome advice from the BMWG.
