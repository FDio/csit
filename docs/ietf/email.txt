As mentioned elsewhere, several comments from MLRsearch AD review
apply to "boilerplate" sections, thus also to future documents.
Therefore I believe possble improvements can be discussed in this thread.

For larger context see a PDF file (it has numbered side comments)
https://github.com/boucadair/IETF-Drafts-Reviews/blob/master/2025/draft-ietf-bmwg-mlrsearch-10-rev%20Med.pdf

First boilerplate section to discuss is Security Considerations.

Besides replacing "black-box" with "opaque", there are three comments.

In relation to the sentence:
"Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically for
benchmarking purposes.",
comment MB109 says:
> Some more elaboration is needed

My opinion is that such capabilities may be present but disabled.
They SHOULD NOT be enabled. If they are enabled, test report MUST
clearly mention this non-default configuration.

In relation to the "SHOULD be identical in" part of sentence:
"Any implications for network security arising
from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production
networks.",
comment MB110 says:
> Why?
>
> We can accept some relax rule in controlled
> environnement, but this not acceptable in deployement.
> I would adjust accordingly.

I guess the sentence is aimed at DUTs with "configurable security".
In production security setting should be high,
so those are the settings that should be benchmarked.
Again benchmarks with "security off" DUT settings may be of interest,
but such benchmarks should be clearly distinguished from the default ones.

The third comment MB111 does not have a corresponding sentence.
> I would some text to basically say
> that the benchmarking results should be adequately
> protected and guards top prevent leaks to unauthorized
> entities.
> Otherwise, the benchmark results can be used by
> attacker to better adjust their attacks and perform attacks
> that would lead to DDoS a node of the DUT in a live
> network, infer the limitation of a DUT that can be used for
> overflow attacks, etc.
>
> Also, we can say that the benchmark is agnostic to trafic

> not a concern.

I vaguely recall some documents already specify
all traffic should be synthetic (no privacy issues),
but the idea to track benchmark results as secret/obscure is new.
I am not sure about that, but we could mention
the set of "authorized entities" for benchmark results
is out of scope of BMWG documents.


Second bolerplate section is Requirements Language.
This time the comments are not aimed to the section 1 itself,
but to the usage of the all-caps verbs in other sections.

The main example is in relation to "MUST" part of sentence:
"Only if this is not the case,
the test report MUST describe the Traffic Profile in a way that
implies how Trial Forwarding Ratio should be calculated.",
comment MB76 wants "SHOULD" instead, saying:
> MUST is an absolute requirement
> (i.e., there is no exception):
>
> 1. MUST This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL",
> mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the
> specification.
>
> SHOULD This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED",
> mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular
> circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full
> implications must be understood and carefully weighed
> before choosing a different course.

This is a class of usage I personally call "conditional requirements".
SHALL is used when the reader can pick their own reasons
to not do the recommended things.
My sentence is conditional on such free decisions of readers
(here in a preceding sentence giving context to "this is not the case"),
but gives additional strong requirements to the reader based on their previous decision.
I guess the original RFC2119 / RFC8174 wording is not directly covering
my "conditional requirements" usage, so it could be updated.
Have you noticed I already used conditional requirements
when discussing MB109 earlier?


For MLRsearch (draft version 11), we did not touch Security Considerations.
We added some text to Requirement Language section, but we did not mention
conditional requirements. We softened the most egregious usage of conditional MUST.
Here is the added text, it may spark additional discussions:
"This document is categorized as an Informational RFC.  While it does
not mandate the adoption of the MLRsearch methodology, it uses the
normative language of BCP 14 to provide an unambiguous specification.
This ensures that if a test procedure or test report claims
compliance with the MLRsearch Specification, it MUST adhere to all
the absolute requirements defined herein.  The use of normative
language is intended to promote repeatable and comparable results
among those who choose to implement this methodology."
