Hi Med, Carsten, Sarah, Giuseppe.

The original e-mail thread had split into multiple branches.

I guess this end is the best for larger discussions around MLRsearch,
and its new version 11:

https://author-tools.ietf.org/iddiff?url2=draft-ietf-bmwg-mlrsearch-11

Most edits are minor improvements for clarity and general readability,
including addressing the comments from AD review by Mohamed Boucadair.

The most important aspect that requires discussion within BMWG
is "positioning".

We added two new sections to this regard:
- 1.2. Positioning within BMWG Methodologies
- 4.1. Scope

We would like to cover this "positioning" in our presentation during the
next BMWG meeting at IETF 123.

For Chairs:

There is some overlap between MLRsearch review comments and larger
discussion happening in "Revisiting BMWG RFCs" e-mail thread that
forked from AD review of mlrsearch.
Will there be a separate slot to discuss "Revisiting BMWG RFCs"?

If yes, we can keep the MLRsearch segment short and narrow
(positioning only), and contribute some discussion to the "Revisiting
BMWG RFCs" discussion, including BMWG "boilerplate" sections:
Requirements Language, and Security Considerations.

For AD/Med:

> Pdf: https://github.com/boucadair/IETF-Drafts-Reviews/blob/master/2025/draft-ietf-bmwg-mlrsearch-10-rev%20Med.pdf

That exported document helpfully numbered your side comments.
We picked up those into comment blocks in our markdown source file.

If you have specific questions on our edits, you may want to look into
the final version-11 source, github mirror URL is:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FDio/csit/b802d684064a1058aa35a1115690b998a296d7f1/docs/ietf/draft-ietf-bmwg-mlrsearch-11.md

For example, if you search for "MB108" (without quotes)
you will find the reason why our tables still do not have proper captions.

Vratko and Maciek
