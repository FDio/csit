- Document MLRv7 code:
 - Vratko to finish editing.
 ?? Other subitems may be moved to come after other main items?
 - Maciek to review for English.
 - Tibor to review for logic and overall readability.
- Terminology freeze:
 - Vratko to compile current terms (perhaps also their old names).
  - This includes the "MLRsearch" term itself.
 - Maciek to review / tweak / approve.
 - Vratko to update code for any changes.
  - Maciek to review again.
- Finite state machines (FSMs):
 - Vratko to write/draw and describe the FSMs as implemented in MLRv7 code.
 - Maciek to review / tweak / approve.
  - Equivalent formulations are possible.
 ?? Does the description of FSMs need specific terminology to agree upon?
  - If yes, agree and update code.
 ?? Restructure code if better FSMs are found and time permits.
- Draft: high level description:
 - Vratko to write.
 - Maciek to review/tweak/approve.
- Draft: low level description:
 - Vratko and Maciek to agree which details should be in draft and which not.
 - Vratko to write.
 - Maciek to review/tweak/approve.
- Draft: Finalize and present to BMWG on an IETF meeting.
- CSIT productization:
 - Vratko to finish integration and gather data with various configurations.
 - Decide on open questions:
  - Migrate reporting from intended load to forwarding rate.
  - Choose the new configurations (ndrpdr, reconf) to use in CSIT production.
 ?? Pilot deployment when most tests stay at v2 but few run also at v7 in trending?
 - Prepare CSIT methodology page with shorter MLRv7 description.
 - Switch CSIT to v7 and monitor for at least one release cycle.
  - Publish the new methodology.
- Logic freeze:
 - Refrain from trying to optimize the code further.
 - Minor tweaks are allowed:
  - Improvements to methodology, code documentation, variable names if needed.
  - Improvements to logging.
  - Bumping Python versions.
   - Apply new language features where convenient.
 - Bigger improvement ideas should go to PLRsearch or a brand new search algorithm.
?? Formal verification, proving MLRsearch cannot get stuck (or slow)
   no mater what the measurement results are.
 ?? Fuzz tests?
