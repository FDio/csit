Original:

> Bridge learning frames are frames with source addresses that are the same as the destination addresses used by the test frames.

Corrected:

> Bridge learning frames are frames with source addresses equal to the destination addresses of the test frames.

Explanation:
Changed "that are the same as" to "equal to". While the original phrasing is grammatically correct, "equal to" is more concise and maintains the technical precision required in a specification document.  This aligns with the overall goal of clarity and conciseness in technical writing.

Corrected:

> The primary reason for extending [RFC2544] is to address the challenges of evaluating and testing the data plane of software-based networking systems.


Explanation:
Removed the unnecessary pluralization of "data planes".  A networking system generally has a single data plane, even if it consists of multiple devices.  The singular "data plane" is more accurate and commonly used in networking terminology.
