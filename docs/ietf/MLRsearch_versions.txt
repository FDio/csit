The python code went through multiple updates,
but many of them can be ignored from IETF point of view
(e.g. adding support for ASTF where
offered trial duration can be way different
from intended duration).

But some of code updates require changes in IETF draft,
and we now have multiple code changes prepared or planned
so here will be a table tracking them.

+----------+---------+-------+-------+
| Goals    | IOrder  | Track | trial |
+==========+=========+=======+=======+
| NDR+PDR  | GiP     | 2pG   | 1     |

Legend:
+ Goals: How many loss ratio goals are supported.
 + NDR+PDR: Unconditional NDR goal, optional configurable PDR goal.
 + Multiple: One or more goals, sorted from low to high loss.
+ IOrder: Iteration order of phases.
 + GiP: Goal in phase, meaning all goals at 1s are bounded before 5s.
 + PiG: Phase in goal, meaning first goal to 30s before second goal starts.
+ Track: How much data from shorter load results is tracked.
 + 2pG: Uper/lower bound from previus phase is tracked for each goal separately.
 + AFS: All results are tracked, but Forgetting Short if a load is re-measured.
 + 2: Only upper and lower bound from immediately preceding phase is tracked.
+ Trial: Whether "sub-trials" are suppoerted.
 + 1: No. Load time is always spent in a single trial.
 + n: Yes. Multiple trials are added (behaves as "1" if load time is short).

Comments to Track:

In other words, the Track column describes what are the starting two values
when a phase starts, and whether older short results are seen
during external search.
With 2 or 2pG, two values come directly from a previous phase, other values
are not seen during external search.
With AFS, the whole result database is searched for the best fit
for starting values, but other values are seen during external search.

With AFS, there can be multiple "maybe does not satisfy" loads from earlier phases
which currently need adding more trials to see if they are a real upper bound.
That is conservative, but maybe too conservative (when acceptance ratio
is 50% and higher). Tracking only 2 bounds (and not seeing old shor results
in external) will simplify the code and may lead to faster search overall.
