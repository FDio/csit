The python code went through multiple updates,
but many of them can be ignored from IETF point of view
(e.g. adding support for ASTF where
offered trial duration can be way different
from intended duration).

But some of code updates require changes in IETF draft,
and we now have multiple code changes prepared or planned
so here will be a table tracking them.

Legend:
+ Version:
 + Numeric value to simplify referencing.
 + v6 may be considered v3.5 in terms of complexity.
+ Gerrit:
 + The number in Gerrit URL.
+ Status: Self-explanatory?
+ Goals: How many loss ratio goals are supported.
 + NDR+PDR: Unconditional NDR goal, optional configurable PDR goal.
 + Multiple: One or more goals, sorted from low to high loss.
+ IOrder: Iteration order of phases.
 + GiP: Goal in phase, meaning all goals at 1s are bounded before 5s starts.
 + PiG: Phase in goal, meaning first goal to 30s before second goal starts.
+ Track: How much data from shorter load results is tracked.
 + 2pG: Uper/lower bound from previus phase is tracked for each goal separately.
 + AFS: All results are tracked, but Forgetting Short if a load is re-measured.
 + 2: Only upper and lower bound from immediately preceding phase is tracked.
+ Trial: Whether "sub-trials" are suppoerted.
 + 1: No. Load time is always spent in a single trial.
 + n: Yes. Multiple trials are added (behaves as "1" if load time is short).

Comments to Track:

In other words, the Track column describes what are the starting two values
when a phase starts, and whether older short results are seen
during external search.
With 2 or 2pG, two values come directly from a previous phase, other values
are not seen during external search.
With AFS, the whole result database is searched for the best fit
for starting values, but other values are seen during external search.

Recall that intermediate phase has 4 actions: initial halving, remeasurement,
external search and internal search.
At least 2 values are required for the first 2 actions, additional values
may (or may not) be helpful in external search (and ignored in internal search).
AFS is better than 2pG in GiP ordering, as it avoids logic complications
v1 had to do in order to share single trial result between goals.
But in PiG ordering, multiple trial durations come into play,
making AFS logic similarly more complicated than "2" tracking
(and simulator shows no benefit of old results on external search).

Additionally, in AFS with subtrials (v4), there can be multiple
"maybe does not satisfy" loads from earlier phases
which currently need adding more trials to see if they are a real upper bound.
That is conservative, but maybe too conservative (when acceptance ratio
is 50% and higher). Tracking only 2 bounds (and not seeing old short results
in external) will simplify the code and may lead to faster search overall.

Due to the complicated and uncertain logic around adding more subtrials
to partially explored load, Vratko decided to cancel v4 and v5.
The state of the art algorithms (TODO: add link to the paper about
recognizing letter boundaries from blurry/noisy photos)
would execute each subtrial at slightly different load,
which fits well into PLRsearch sructure,
not into "hard boundaries" MLRsearch.
MLRsearch is expected to refine (or ignore) many partially explored loads,
thus losing much of the effectivity we wanted to gain from subtrials.
With "2" tracking (v5) the effectivity loss would be smaller,
so perhaps cancellation of v5 is premature, but other objections remain
(ignoring loads even if they are likely to become upper bounds,
complicated logic, not following the state of the art).

Reducing Track from AFS to 2 (from v3 to v6) is still expected
to simplify the logic (definitely) and probably also to gain some speed
(has to be verified).

One more open question: If we want to be conservative, should lossy short trials
be hard upper bounds (not erased by remeasurement)?
