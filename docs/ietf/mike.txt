Hi Mike, thanks for the review!

In the meantime, we got reviews from other people,
our edits are visible here: [1] (rendered diff) and [2] (source).

> Can you reword on "Process of inconsistent trial results carefully."?
> Perhaps something like "Define handling of inconsistent trial results"?

I went with "Clarify handling of inconsistent trial results".

> There are references to existing approaches as "vanilla" or "plain." These are
> presumably referring to RFC2544's behavior?

Not exactly. The description in RFC2544 is quite vague,
it does not neccessitate bisecting, and it allows short trials.

Most equipment vendors keep their implementations closed-source,
and the few open-source implementations we found are not
wide-spread enough to become a reference.
Also they have quirks, like returning the average of last two bounds,
which I do not think are strictly compatible with RFC2544.

Section 2.13.2 of TST009 (step B-01) is the only reference specific enough,
but it includes rounding.

Some of these explanations could be turned into a text update for the document,
but I doubt such technicalities would be helpful for uninitiated reader.
Perhaps we can just move the "reminder" list from the end of section 2.1.
to a more prominent location?

> ... conventions on capitalization

As replied to other reviewers, the usage of capitalization is currently
not consistent enough, we just did not have enough time to improve it.

I prefer adding references, which we did not have enough time to do properly.

We are already using those...

> 5.6.1, "Appendix B (Appendix B)" => "Appendix B"

...and this is an example consequence.
The (Appendix B) part is added automatically, so I edited the text before parenthesis.

> 1.1, "takes long" => "takes a long time"

Done.

> 1.1, "Search Goal (Section 4.6.7)s," => "Search Goals (Section 4.6.7)"

Done.

> 2.1, "[RFC2544" => "[RFC2544]" (and link, presumably)

Closed the bracket.

> 2.3 and 4.10.3, "60 seconds trial" => "60-second trial"

Replaced (in multiple places).

> 4.5.4, bulleted list is collapsed into a paragraph and "Section 8, 12,
> and..." => "Sections 8, 12, and..."

Oh, making kramdown understand two-layer lists inside indented Discussion section is hard.
I did something, by sacrificing higher list layer,
but it still leaks an additional "empty" line containing one space. :(

> 4.10.3, "get compatible Search Result"
>  => "get compatible Search Results" or "get a compatible Search Result"

Inserted the missing "a".
Grammar around definite and indefinite particles is another area
we did not find time to fix properly.

> 5, "Section MLRsearch Specification (Section 4)" => "Section 4"

Another victim of our markdown linking.
I removed the first "Section", but two "specification" words
(only one capitalized) this close together still look wrong.
Not wrong enough to hardcode section number, yet.

Vratko.
