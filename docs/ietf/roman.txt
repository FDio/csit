Hi Roman, thanks for the review!

Not sure how your e-mail got marked as read in my e-mail client
without me realizing, thanks Med for the reminder.

Yeah, it is only implied.
While RFC 2544 section 24.(Trial duration) mentions
"binary search" (in quotes) and "search procedure" (without quotes),
the section 26.1(Throughput) only mentions nouns "procedure" and "result"
and verb the "determine" (all without quotes).

I think that for experienced practitioners it is clear
that "search" in section 24 refers to throughput,
as Back-to-back frames from section 26.4 is the only other procedure
that searches for something, but that uses short bursts, not long trials.
But I agree, we should not presume mlrsearch reader
knows that when reading the abstract.

Looking at the text of the abstract,
I am not sure I would use the word "extensions" anymore,
so I do not have a specific edit yet.
Maybe Maciek will have.

Yes, but probably not in the mlrsearch document.
It comes from a "boilerplate" sections re-used across many BMWG documents,
updating them should come with larger consensus.
I started the discussion [1] on the mailing list.
