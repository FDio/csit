In this talk we introduce fd.io project and its CSIT sub-project,
give an overview of the ways its PAL component presents test results.
We will focus on performance results and anomaly detection,
as a way to distinguish (probably) real performance changes from the noisy data.

If you are interested in performance testing in general,
or fd.io project specifically, this talk is for you.
