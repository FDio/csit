Title: FD.io CSIT Performance Benchmarking, Anomaly Detection, Results Tracking.

In this talk we introduce FD.io CSIT core sub-project and give an overview of
the ways its Presentation-Analytics-Layer (PAL) component presents test
results. We will focus on performance results and anomaly detection, as a way
to distinguish (probably) real performance changes from the noisy data. And
provide a sneak peak into the way test results data is processed.

Will use performance data from CI/CD automated tests executed on Intel Xeon
(skx, clx, icx), Atom, Arm servers running in labs hosted by LFN FD.io.

If you are interested in network performance testing in general, or FD.io
project specifically, this talk is for you.
