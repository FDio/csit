# Root Cause Analysis for Regressions

List of RCAs in CSIT 24.02 for VPP performance regressions.
Not listing differences caused by known issues (uneven worker load
due to randomized RSS or other per-worker issues).
Also not listing tests which historically show large performance variance.

Contrary to issues, these genuine regressions do not limit usefulness
of CSIT testing. So even if they are not fixed
(e.g. when the regression is an expected consequence of added functionality),
they will not be re-listed in the next release report.
