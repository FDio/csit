# Known Issues

These are issues that cause test failures or otherwise limit usefulness of CSIT
testing.

## New

Any issue listed here may have been present also in a previous release,
but was not detected/recognized/reported enough back then.
Also, issues previously thought fixed but now reopened are listed here.

**#** | **JiraID**                                       | **Issue Description**

## Previous

Issues reported in previous releases which still affect the current results.

## Fixed

**#** | **JiraID**                                       | **Issue Description**
------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------

Not listing issues that became unreproducible, e.g. by CSIT decomissioning older testbeds.

# Root Cause Analysis for Regressions

List of RCAs in CSIT 25.02 for VPP performance regressions.
Not listing differences caused by known issues (uneven worker load
due to randomized RSS or other per-worker issues).
Also not listing tests which historically show large performance variance.

Contrary to issues, these genuine regressions do not limit usefulness
of CSIT testing. So even if they are not fixed
(e.g. when the regression is an expected consequence of added functionality),
they will not be re-listed in the next release report.
