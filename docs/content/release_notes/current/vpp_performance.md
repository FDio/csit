# Root Cause Analysis for Regressions

List of RCAs in CSIT 23.10 for VPP performance regressions.

Contrary to issues, these to not limit usefulness of CSIT testing.
So even if they are not fixed (e.g. when the regression is an expected
consequence of added functionality), they will not be re-listed in the next
release report.
