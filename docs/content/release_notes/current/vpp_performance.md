# CSIT 25.06 - VPP Performance

1. TEST FRAMEWORK
    - **CSIT test environment** version is ver. 18, see
      [Environment Versioning]({{< ref "../../../infrastructure/fdio_csit_testbed_versioning" >}}).
    - **General Code Housekeeping**: Ongoing code optimizations and bug fixes.

# Known Issues

These are issues that cause test failures or otherwise limit usefulness of CSIT
testing.

## New

Any issue listed here may have been present also in a previous release,
but was not detected/recognized/reported enough back then.
Also, issues previously thought fixed but now reopened are listed here.
For reporting reasons, even issues fixed during release are listed here,
as long as they caused some results to be missing (or performance wrong).

**#** | **Github issue number**                                      | **Issue Description**
------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------
  1   |                                                              |

## Previous

Issues reported in previous releases which still affect the current results
(or would be affecting if other issues were not hiding the symptoms):

**#** | **Github issue number**                                      | **Issue Description**
------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------
  1   |                                                              |

## Fixed

Issues reported in previous releases which were fixed
(or stopped being tested forever) in this release:

**#** | **Github issue number**                                      | **Issue Description**
------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------
  1   |                                                              |

# Root Cause Analysis for Regressions

List of RCAs in CSIT 25.06 for VPP performance regressions.
Not listing differences caused by known issues (uneven worker load
due to randomized RSS or other per-worker issues).
Also not listing tests which historically show large performance variance.

Contrary to issues, these genuine regressions do not limit usefulness
of CSIT testing. So even if they are not fixed
(e.g. when the regression is an expected consequence of added functionality),
they will not be re-listed in the next release report.

**#** | **Github issue number**                                      | **Issue Description**
------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------
  1   |                                                              |
