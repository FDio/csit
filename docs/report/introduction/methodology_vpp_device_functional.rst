VPP_Device Functional
---------------------

|csit-release| includes VPP_Device test environment for functional VPP
device tests integrated into LFN CI/CD infrastructure. VPP_Device tests
run on 1-Node testbeds (1n-skx, 1n-arm) and rely on Linux SRIOV Virtual
Function (VF), dot1q VLAN tagging and external loopback cables to
facilitate packet passing over exernal physical links. Initial focus is
on few baseline tests. Existing CSIT Performance tests can be moved to
VPP_Device framework. RF test definition code stays unchanged with the
exception of traffic generator related L2 KWs.
