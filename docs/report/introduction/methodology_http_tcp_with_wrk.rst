HTTP/TCP with WRK
-----------------

`WRK HTTP benchmarking tool <https://github.com/wg/wrk>`_ is used for
TCP/IP and HTTP tests of VPP Host Stack and built-in static HTTP server.
WRK has been chosen as it is capable of generating significant TCP/IP
and HTTP loads by scaling number of threads across multi-core processors.

This in turn enables high scale benchmarking of the VPP Host Stack TCP/IP
and HTTP service including HTTP TCP/IP Connections-Per-Second (CPS) and
HTTP Requests-Per-Second.

The initial tests are designed as follows:

- HTTP and TCP/IP Connections-Per-Second (CPS)

  - WRK configured to use 8 threads across 8 cores, 1 thread per core.
  - Maximum of 50 concurrent connections across all WRK threads.
  - Timeout for server responses set to 5 seconds.
  - Test duration is 30 seconds.
  - Expected HTTP test sequence:

    - Single HTTP GET Request sent per open connection.
    - Connection close after valid HTTP reply.
    - Resulting flow sequence - 8 packets: >Syn, <Syn-Ack, >Ack, >Req,
      <Rep, >Fin, <Fin, >Ack.

- HTTP Requests-Per-Second

  - WRK configured to use 8 threads across 8 cores, 1 thread per core.
  - Maximum of 50 concurrent connections across all WRK threads.
  - Timeout for server responses set to 5 seconds.
  - Test duration is 30 seconds.
  - Expected HTTP test sequence:

    - Multiple HTTP GET Requests sent in sequence per open connection.
    - Connection close after set test duration time.
    - Resulting flow sequence: >Syn, <Syn-Ack, >Ack, >Req[1], <Rep[1],
      .., >Req[n], <Rep[n], >Fin, <Fin, >Ack.
