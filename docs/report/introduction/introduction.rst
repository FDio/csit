Introduction
============

This is FD.io CSIT (Fast Data i/o Continuous System Integration and
Testing) project report for |csit-release| system performance and
functional testing of |vpp-release|.

There is also a downloadable `PDF version of this report`_.

This report describes CSIT performance and functional tests delivered in
|csit-release|. A high-level overview is provided for each CSIT test
environment running in :abbr:`LF (Linux Foundation)` FD.io Continuous
Performance Labs. This is followed by summary of all executed tests
against the |vpp-release| and associated FD.io projects and sub-systems
(Honeycomb, DPDK, NSH_SFC, DMM), |csit-release| release notes, result
highlights and known issues discovered in CSIT. More detailed
description of each environment, pointers to CSIT test code
documentation and detailed test resuls with links to the source data
files are also provided.
