General Notes
=============

All CSIT test results listed in this report are sourced and auto-generated
from output.xml Robot Framework (RF) files resulting from LF FD.io Jenkins
jobs execution against VPP-17.01 release artifacts. References are provided
to the original LF FD.io Jenkins job results. However, as LF FD.io Jenkins
infrastructure does not automatically archive all jobs (history record is
provided for the last 30 days or 40 jobs only), additional references are
provided to the RF result files that got archived in FD.io nexus online
storage system.

CSIT |release| report does also include VPP unit test results.  These tests
have been developed within the FD.io VPP project, and not in CSIT, but they do
complement tests done by CSIT. They are provided mainly as a reference, to
give the reader a more complete view of automated testing executed against
VPP-17.01 release.
