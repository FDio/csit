To identify performance changes due to TRex code development between previous
and current TRex  version, both have been tested in CSIT environment of latest
version and compared against each other. All substantial progressions and
regressions have been marked up with RCA analysis. See
:ref:`trex_throughput_comparisons` (to be added in 2022)
and :ref:`trex_known_issues`.

Physical Testbeds
-----------------

FD.io CSIT performance tests are executed in physical testbeds hosted by
:abbr:`LF (Linux Foundation)` for FD.io project. Physical testbed
topology used:

- **1-Node Topology**: Consisting of TG with 1 NIC with 2 ports connected
  together - loopback connection.
