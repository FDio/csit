General Remarks
===============

All CSIT test results listed in this report are sourced and auto-generated
from output.xml Robot Framework (RF) files resulting from LF FD.io Jenkins
jobs execution against VPP-17.01 release artifacts. References are provided
to the original LF FD.io Jenkins job results. However, as LF FD.io Jenkins
infrastructure does not automatically archive all jobs (history record is
provided for the last 30 dayts or 40 jobs only), additional references are
provided to the RF result files that got archived in FD.io nexus online
storage system.

CSIT |release| report does also include VPP make test results, mainly as
a reference. Although these tests have not been developed FD.io CSIT project,
but inthe FD.io VPP project, they have been provided in this report to give
reader a more complete view of automated testing executed against VPP-17.01
release, as they do complement tests done by CSIT.
