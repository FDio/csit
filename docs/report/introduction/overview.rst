========

This is the FD.io Continuous System Integration and Testing (CSIT) project
report for CSIT |release| system testing of VPP-17.01 release. Initial
sections describe progress of continuous functional and performance test
automation development work completed in FD.io CSIT |release|, followed by
high-level overview of the test environment in Linux Foundation FD.io
performance labs (a.k.a. FD.io Continuous Performance Labs) and result
highlights. Subsequent sections list the detailed results generated by CSIT
system executing CSIT Jenkins jobs running tests in FD.io CPL environment
against the VPP-17.01 release and associated sub-systems (HoneyComb, DPDK).

Framework (RF) and Python.

CSIT |release| source code for the executed test suites is available in CSIT branch
|release| in the directory ./tests/<name_of_the_test_suite>. A local copy of CSIT
source code can be obtained by cloning CSIT git repository ("git clone
