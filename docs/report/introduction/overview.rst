Overview
========

This is the **F**\ast **D**\ata **I**/**O** Project (FD.io) **C**\ontinuous
**S**\ystem **I**\ntegration and **T**\esting (CSIT) project report for CSIT
|release| system testing of VPP-17.01 release. Initial sections of the report
describe FD.io functional and performance tests and their continuous execution
achieved in CSIT |release|. This is followed by high-level overview of FD.io
test environments running in Linux Foundation (LF) FD.io Continuous
Performance Labs), CSIT |release| release notes and result highlights.
Subsequent sections list the functional and performance detailed test results
generated by LF FD.io Jenkins system executing CSIT jobs running tests
against the VPP-17.01 release and associated sub-systems (HoneyComb, DPDK).

The exact structure of the report is as follows:

#. ``Introduction`` - Includes: ``Overview`` - this section;
   ``CSIT Test Naming`` - describing CSIT naming convention for test suites and
   test cases, important to understand to correctly interpret the reported
   results; ``General Remarks`` - additional notes related to this report.
#. ``VPP Performance Tests HW`` - Summary of VPP performance tests executed in
   physical Hardware testbed. Includes: ``Overview`` - containing topology
   description and list of executed tests; ``Performance Tests Naming`` - lists
   CSIT naming specifics for performance tests; ``CSIT Release Notes`` - with
   changes in CSIT |release| including major test additions, performance
   improvements, changes in testing environment and methodology and known
   issues; ``Performance Measurements Methodology`` - details testing
   methodology followed for multi-thread multi-core, packet throughput and
   latency, and KVM VM vhost tests; ``Report Addendum Targets`` - lists content
   to be added to this report as part of CSIT |release|.

FD.io CSIT system is developed using two main coding platforms: Robot
Framework (RF) and Python. CSIT |release| source code for the executed test
suites is available in CSIT branch |release| in the directory
"./tests/<name_of_the_test_suite>". A local copy of CSIT source code can be
obtained by cloning CSIT git repository - "git clone
https://gerrit.fd.io/r/csit". The CSIT testing virtual environment can be run
on a local computer workstation (laptop, server) using Vagrant by following
the instructions in `CSIT tutorials
<https://wiki.fd.io/view/CSIT#Tutorials>`_.
