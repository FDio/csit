Overview
========

This is the **F**\ast **D**\ata **I**/**O** Project (**FD.io**) **C**\ontinuous
**S**\ystem **I**\ntegration and **T**\esting (**CSIT**) project report for CSIT
|release| system testing of |vpp-release|.

The report describes CSIT functional and performance tests and their
continuous execution delivered in CSIT |release|. A high-level overview is
provided for each CSIT test environment running in Linux Foundation (LF) FD.io
Continuous Performance Labs. This is followed by summary of all executed tests
against the |vpp-release| and associated FD.io projects and sub-systems
(HoneyComb, DPDK), CSIT |release| release notes, result highlights and known
issues discovered in CSIT. More detailed description of each environment,
pointers to CSIT test code documentation and detailed test resuls with links to
the source data files are also provided.
