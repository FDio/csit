Overview
========

This is the **F**ast **D**ata **I**/**O** Project (FD.io) **C**ontinuous
**S**ystem **I**ntegration and **T**esting (CSIT) project report for CSIT
|release| system testing of VPP-17.01 release. Initial sections of the report
describe FD.io functional and performance tests and their continuous execution
achieved in CSIT |release|. This is followed by high-level overview of FD.io
test environments running in Linux Foundation (LF) FD.io Continuous
Performance Labs), CSIT |release| release notes and result highlights.
Subsequent sections list the functional and performance detailed test results
generated by LF FD.io Jenkins system executing CSIT jobs running tests
against the VPP-17.01 release and associated sub-systems (HoneyComb, DPDK).

The exact structure of the report is as follows:

#. ``Introduction`` - Includes: ``Overview`` - this section; ``CSIT Test Naming`` - describing CSIT naming convention for test suites and test cases, important to understand to correctly interpret the reported results; ``General Remarks`` - additional notes related to this report.
#. ``VPP Performance Tests HW`` - Summary of VPP performance tests executed in physical Hardware testbed. Includes: ``Overview`` - containing topology description and list of executed tests; ``Performance Tests Naming`` - lists CSIT naming specifics for performance tests; ``Performance Improvements`` - lists performance deltas recorded in rls1701 vs. rls1609; ``Performance Measurements Methodology`` - details testing methodology followed for multi-thread multi-core, packet throughput and latency, and KVM VM vhost tests; ``Report Addendum Targets`` - lists content to be added to this report as part of CSIT |release|; ``Known Issues`` - contains known CSIT test and CSIT infra issues.

FD.io CSIT system is developed using two main coding platforms: Robot
Framework (RF) and Python. CSIT |release| source code for the executed test
suites is available in CSIT branch |release| in the directory
"./tests/<name_of_the_test_suite>". A local copy of CSIT source code can be
obtained by cloning CSIT git repository - "git clone
https://gerrit.fd.io/r/csit". The CSIT testing virtual environment can be run
on a local computer workstation (laptop, server) using Vagrant by following
the instructions in `CSIT tutorials
<https://wiki.fd.io/view/CSIT#Tutorials>`_.
