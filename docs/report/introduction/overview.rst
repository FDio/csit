This is the Fast Data Project (FD.io) Continuous System Integration and Testing
(CSIT) project report for CSIT |release| system testing of VPP-17.01 release.
Initial sections of the report describe FD.io functional and performance tests
and their continuous execution achieved in CSIT |release|. This is followed by
high-level overview of FD.io test environments running in Linux Foundation
(LF) FD.io Continuous Performance Labs), CSIT |release| release notes and
result highlights. Subsequent sections list the functional and performance
detailed test results generated by LF FD.io Jenkins system executing CSIT jobs
running tests  against the VPP-17.01 release and associated sub-systems
(HoneyComb, DPDK).

FD.io CSIT system is developed using two main coding platforms: Robot
Framework (RF) and Python. CSIT |release| source code for the executed test
suites is available in CSIT branch |release| in the directory
"./tests/<name_of_the_test_suite>". A local copy of CSIT source code can be
obtained by cloning CSIT git repository - "git clone
https://gerrit.fd.io/r/csit". The CSIT testing virtual environment can be run
on a local computer workstation (laptop, server) using Vagrant by following
the instructions in `CSIT tutorials
<https://wiki.fd.io/view/CSIT#Tutorials>`_.
