Overview
========

This is the **F**\ast **D**\ata **I**/**O** Project (FD.io) **C**\ontinuous
**S**\ystem **I**\ntegration and **T**\esting (CSIT) project report for CSIT
|release| system testing of VPP-17.01 release. Initial sections of the report
describe FD.io functional and performance tests and their continuous execution
achieved in CSIT |release|. This is followed by high-level overview of FD.io
test environments running in Linux Foundation (LF) FD.io Continuous
Performance Labs), CSIT |release| release notes and result highlights.
Subsequent sections list the functional and performance detailed test results
generated by LF FD.io Jenkins system executing CSIT jobs running tests
against the VPP-17.01 release and associated sub-systems (HoneyComb, DPDK).

   tests to be added in the next revision of CSIT |release| report; *Packet
   Throughput Graphs* and *Packet Latency Graphs* - plotted NDR, PDR
   throughput and latency results from multiple CSIT performance jobs
   executions ; *Test Environment* - detailed test environment description ;

   part of vpp make test verify option within the FD.io VPP project. Listed in
   this report to give a more complete view about executed VPP functional tests;
   includes: *Overview* - short overview of tested topologies and executed
   tests; *Test Environment* - VPPtest environment description ; *Documentation*
   - pointers to VPPtest documentation.
#. *Detailed Test Results* - auto-generated results from CSIT jobs executions

   Results*, *HoneyComb Functional Results*, *VPPtest Functional Results*.

FD.io CSIT system is developed using two main coding platforms: Robot
Framework (RF) and Python. CSIT |release| source code for the executed test
suites is available in CSIT branch |release| in the directory
"./tests/<name_of_the_test_suite>". A local copy of CSIT source code can be
obtained by cloning CSIT git repository - "git clone
https://gerrit.fd.io/r/csit". The CSIT testing virtual environment can be run
on a local computer workstation (laptop, server) using Vagrant by following
the instructions in `CSIT tutorials
<https://wiki.fd.io/view/CSIT#Tutorials>`_.
