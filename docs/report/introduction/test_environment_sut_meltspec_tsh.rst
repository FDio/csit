Spectre and Meltdown Checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Following section displays the output of a running shell script to tell if
system is vulnerable against the several "speculative execution" CVEs that were
made public in 2018. Script is available on `Spectre & Meltdown Checker Github
<https://github.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker>`_.
