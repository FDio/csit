HTTP/TCP with WRK Tool
----------------------

`WRK HTTP benchmarking tool <https://github.com/wg/wrk>`_ is used for
experimental TCP/IP and HTTP tests of VPP TCP/IP stack and built-in
static HTTP server. WRK has been chosen as it is capable of generating
significant TCP/IP and HTTP loads by scaling number of threads across
multi-core processors.

This in turn enables quite high scale benchmarking of the main TCP/IP
and HTTP service including HTTP TCP/IP Connections-Per-Second (CPS),
HTTP Requests-Per-Second and HTTP Bandwidth Throughput.

The initial tests are designed as follows:

- HTTP and TCP/IP Connections-Per-Second (CPS)

  - WRK configured to use 8 threads across 8 cores, 1 thread per core.
  - Maximum of 50 concurrent connections across all WRK threads.
  - Timeout for server responses set to 5 seconds.
  - Test duration is 30 seconds.
  - Expected HTTP test sequence:

    - Single HTTP GET Request sent per open connection.
    - Connection close after valid HTTP reply.
    - Resulting flow sequence - 8 packets: >Syn, <Syn-Ack, >Ack, >Req,
      <Rep, >Fin, <Fin, >Ack.

- HTTP Requests-Per-Second

  - WRK configured to use 8 threads across 8 cores, 1 thread per core.
  - Maximum of 50 concurrent connections across all WRK threads.
  - Timeout for server responses set to 5 seconds.
  - Test duration is 30 seconds.
  - Expected HTTP test sequence:

    - Multiple HTTP GET Requests sent in sequence per open connection.
    - Connection close after set test duration time.
    - Resulting flow sequence: >Syn, <Syn-Ack, >Ack, >Req[1], <Rep[1],
      .., >Req[n], <Rep[n], >Fin, <Fin, >Ack.
