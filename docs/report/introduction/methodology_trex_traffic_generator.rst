TRex Traffic Generator
----------------------

Usage
~~~~~

`TRex traffic generator <https://trex-tgn.cisco.com>`_ is used for all
CSIT performance tests. TRex stateless mode is used to measure NDR and
PDR throughputs using MLRsearch and to measure maximum transer rate
in MRR tests.

TRex is installed and run on the TG compute node. The typical procedure is:

- If TRex is not already installed on TG, it is installed in the
  suite setup phase - see `TRex installation`_.
- TRex configuration is set in its configuration file
  ::

  /etc/trex_cfg.yaml

- TRex is started in background mode
  ::

  $ sh -c 'cd <t-rex-install-dir>/scripts/ && sudo nohup ./t-rex-64 -i --prefix $(hostname) --hdrh --no-scapy-server > /tmp/trex.log 2>&1 &' > /dev/null

- There are traffic streams dynamically prepared for each test, based on traffic
  profiles. The traffic is sent and the statistics obtained using
  :command:`trex.stl.api.STLClient`.

Measuring Packet Loss
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following sequence is performed to measure packet loss:

- Create an instance of STLClient.
- Connect to the client.
- Add all streams.
- Clear statistics.
- Send the traffic for defined time.
- Retrieve the statistics.

If there is a warm-up phase required, the same traffic is sent before the actual
test and the statistics are cleared again after this phase completes.

Measuring Latency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If measurement of latency is requested, two more packet streams are
created (one for each direction) with TRex flow_stats parameter set to
STLFlowLatencyStats. In that case, returned statistics will also include
min/avg/max latency values and encoded HDRHstogram data.
