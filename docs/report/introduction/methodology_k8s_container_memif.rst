K8s Container Memif
-------------------

CSIT includes tests of VPP topologies running in K8s
orchestrated Pods/Containers and connected over memif virtual
interfaces. In order to provide simple topology coding flexibility and
extensibility container orchestration is done with `Kubernetes
<https://github.com/kubernetes>`_ using `Docker
<https://github.com/docker>`_ images for all container applications
including VPP. `Ligato <https://github.com/ligato>`_ is used for the
Pod/Container networking orchestration that is integrated with K8s,
including memif support.

In these tests VPP vswitch runs in a K8s Pod with Docker Container (DRC)
handling NIC interfaces and connecting over memif to more instances of
VPP running in Pods/DRCs. All DRCs run in a priviliged mode with VPP
data plane worker threads pinned to dedicated physical CPU cores per
usual CSIT practice. All VPP instances run the same version of software.
This test topology is equivalent to existing tests with vhost-user and
VMs as described earlier in :ref:`tested_physical_topologies`.

Further documentation is available in
:ref:`container_orchestration_in_csit`.
