SPECTRE - MELTDOWN Checks - Skylake
-----------------------------------

Following section displays the output of a running shell script to tell if
system is vulnerable against the several "speculative execution" CVEs that were
made public in 2018. Script is available on `Spectre & Meltdown Checker Github
<https://github.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker>`_.

- CVE-2017-5753 [bounds check bypass] aka 'Spectre Variant 1'
- CVE-2017-5715 [branch target injection] aka 'Spectre Variant 2'
- CVE-2017-5754 [rogue data cache load] aka 'Meltdown' aka 'Variant 3'
- CVE-2018-3640 [rogue system register read] aka 'Variant 3a'
- CVE-2018-3639 [speculative store bypass] aka 'Variant 4'
- CVE-2018-3615 [L1 terminal fault] aka 'Foreshadow (SGX)'
- CVE-2018-3620 [L1 terminal fault] aka 'Foreshadow-NG (OS)'
- CVE-2018-3646 [L1 terminal fault] aka 'Foreshadow-NG (VMM)'
