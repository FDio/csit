Virtual Topologies
------------------

CSIT DMM functional tests are executed in VM-based virtual topologies
created on demand using :abbr:`VIRL (Virtual Internet Routing Lab)`
simulation platform contributed by Cisco. VIRL runs on physical
baremetal servers hosted by LF FD.io project.

All tests are executed in three-node virtual test topology shown in the
figure below.

SUT1 and SUT2 are two VMs (running Ubuntu), TG is a Traffic Generator VM
(running Ubuntu). SUTs run
sample server-client application using the DMM libraries in Linux user-
mode as a Device Under Test (DUT) within the VM. Currently TG node is
not being used in DMM-CSIT. Network connectivity between SUTs and to TG
is provided using virtual NICs and VMs' virtio drivers.

Functional Tests Coverage
-------------------------

|csit-release| includes following DMM functionality tested in virtual VM
environment:

+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Functionality         |  Description                                 |
+=======================+==============================================+
| DMM basic operation   | DMM has only one test case right now. The    |
|                       | testcase demonstrates single server[DUT1]    |
|                       | and single client[DUT2] scenario using DMM   |
|                       | framework and kernel tcp/ip stack.           |
|                       |                                              |
|                       | Test case count: 1.                          |
