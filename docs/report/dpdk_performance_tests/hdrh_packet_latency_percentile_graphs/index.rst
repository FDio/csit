Latency by Percentile Distribution
==================================

Latency results are generated from a single execution of NDRPDR discovery
test across physical testbeds hosted LF FD.io labs: 3n-hsw, 2n-skx, 3n-
skx, 2n-clx.

.. note::

    Test results have been generated by
    `FD.io test executor dpdk performance job 2n-skx`_,
    `FD.io test executor dpdk performance job 3n-skx`_,
    `FD.io test executor dpdk performance job 2n-clx`_ and
    `FD.io test executor dpdk performance job 3n-hsw`_ with RF
    result files csit-dpdk-perf-|srelease|-\*.zip
    `archived here <../../_static/archive/>`_.
