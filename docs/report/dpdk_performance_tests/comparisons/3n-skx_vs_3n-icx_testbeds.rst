3n-Skx vs 3n-Icx Testbeds
-------------------------

Relative comparison of |dpdk-release| Testpmd and L3fwd packet
throughput (NDR, PDR and MRR) is calculated for the same tests executed
on 3-Node Skylake (3n-skx) and 3-Node Ice Lake (3n-icx) physical testbed
types, in 1-core, 2-core and 4-core configurations.

.. note::

    Test results are stored in
    `build logs from FD.io dpdk performance job 3n-skx`_ and
    `build logs from FD.io dpdk performance job 3n-icx`_
    with RF result files csit-dpdk-perf-|srelease|-\*.zip
    `archived here <../../_static/archive/>`_.
