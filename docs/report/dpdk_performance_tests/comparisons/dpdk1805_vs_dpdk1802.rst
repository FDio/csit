DPDK-18.05 vs. DPDK-18.02
-------------------------

Relative DPDK performance comparision in measured for DPDK-18.05 NDR and
PDR packet throughput in |csit-release| report is calculated against the
DPDK-18.02 test results from |csit-release-1| report, for tests running
on 3-Node Intel Xeon Haswell testbeds (3n-hsw) in 1-core and 2-core
configurations.

Listed mean and standard deviation values are computed based on a series
of the same tests executed against respective VPP releases to verify
test results repeatability, with percentage change calculated for mean
values.
