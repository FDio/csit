Current vs. Previous Release
----------------------------

Relative comparison of DPDK Testpmd and L3fwd packet throughput (NDR,
PDR and MRR) between |dpdk-release| and DPDK-18.02 (measured for
|csit-release| and |csit-release-1| respectively) is calculated from
results of tests running on 3-Node Intel Xeon Haswell testbeds (3n-hsw)
in 1-core and 2-core configurations.

Listed mean and standard deviation values are computed based on a series
of the same tests executed against respective DPDK releases to verify
test results repeatability, with percentage change calculated for mean
values.

.. note::

    Test results have been generated by
    `FD.io test executor dpdk performance job 3n-hsw`_
    with RF result
