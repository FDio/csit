Current vs. Previous Release
----------------------------

Relative comparison of DPDK Testpmd and L3fwd packet throughput (NDR,
PDR and MRR) between |dpdk-release| and DPDK-18.02 (measured for |csit-
release| and |csit-release-1| respectively) is calculated from results
of tests running on 3-Node Intel Xeon Haswell testbeds (3n-hsw) in
1-core, 2-core and 4-core (MRR only) configurations.

Listed mean and standard deviation values are computed based on a series
of the same tests executed against respective DPDK releases to verify
test results repeatability, with percentage change calculated for mean
values.
