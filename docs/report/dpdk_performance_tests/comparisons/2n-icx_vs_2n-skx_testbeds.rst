2n-Icx vs 2n-Skx Testbeds
-------------------------

Relative comparison of |dpdk-release| Testpmd and L3fwd packet
throughput (NDR, PDR) is calculated for the same tests executed
on 2-Node Cascadelake (2n-skx) and 2-Node Ice Lake (2n-icx) physical testbed
types, in 1-core, 2-core and 4-core configurations.

.. note::

    Test results are stored in
    `build logs from FD.io dpdk performance job 2n-skx`_ and
    `build logs from FD.io dpdk performance job 2n-icx`_
    with RF result files csit-dpdk-perf-|srelease|-\*.zip
    `archived here <../../_static/archive/>`_.
