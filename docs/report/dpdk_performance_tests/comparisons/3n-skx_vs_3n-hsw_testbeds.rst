3n-Skx vs. 3n-Hsw Testbeds
--------------------------

Relative comparison of |dpdk-release| Testpmd and L3fwd packet
throughput (NDR, PDR and MRR) is calculated for the same tests executed
on 3-Node Skylake (3n-skx) and 3-Node Haswell (3n-hsw) physical testbed
types, in 1-core, 2-core and 4-core configurations.

NDR Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NDR throughput comparison between testbeds is available in CSV and
pretty ASCII formats:
