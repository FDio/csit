3n-Skx vs. 3n-Hsw Testbeds
--------------------------

Relative |dpdk-release| Testpmd and L3fwd performance comparison in
measured NDR, PDR and MRR packet throughput is calculated for tests
executed on 3-Node Skylake (3n-skx) and 3-Node Haswell (3n-hsw) physical
testbed types in 1-core configurations.

NDR Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NDR throughput comparison between testbeds is available in CSV and
pretty ASCII formats:
