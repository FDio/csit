Packet Throughput
=================

Throughput graphs are generated by multiple executions of the same
performance tests across physical testbeds hosted LF FD.io labs:
2n-skx, 3n-skx, 2n-clx, 2n-tx2, 2n-zn2, 3n-tsh.
Box-and-Whisker plots are used to display variations in
measured throughput values, without making any assumptions of the
underlying statistical distribution.

For each test case, Box-and-Whisker plots show the quartiles (Min, 1st
quartile / 25th percentile, 2nd quartile / 50th percentile / mean, 3rd
quartile / 75th percentile, Max) across collected data set. Outliers are
plotted as individual points.

Additional information about graph data:

#. **Graph Title**: describes tested packet path, testbed topology,
   processor model, NIC model, packet size, number of cores and
   threads used by data plane workers and indication of DPDK DUT
   configuration.

#. **X-axis Labels**: indices of individual test suites as listed in
   Graph Legend.

#. **Y-axis Labels**: measured Packets Per Second [pps] throughput
   values.

#. **Graph Legend**: lists X-axis indices with associated CSIT test
   suites executed to generate graphed test results.

#. **Hover Information**: lists minimum, first quartile, median,
   third quartile, and maximum. If either type of outlier is present the
   whisker on the appropriate side is taken to 1.5×IQR from the quartile
   (the "inner fence") rather than the max or min, and individual outlying
   data points are displayed as unfilled circles (for suspected outliers)
   or filled circles (for outliers). (The "outer fence" is 3×IQR from the
   quartile.)

.. note::

    Test results are stored in
    `build logs from FD.io dpdk performance job 2n-icx`_,
    `build logs from FD.io dpdk performance job 3n-icx`_,
    `build logs from FD.io dpdk performance job 2n-skx`_,
    `build logs from FD.io dpdk performance job 3n-skx`_,
    `build logs from FD.io dpdk performance job 2n-clx`_,
    `build logs from FD.io dpdk performance job 2n-zn2`_,
    `build logs from FD.io dpdk performance job 3n-alt`_,
    `build logs from FD.io dpdk performance job 3n-tsh`_,
    `build logs from FD.io dpdk performance job 2n-tx2`_ with RF
    result files csit-dpdk-perf-|srelease|-\*.zip
    `archived here <../../_static/archive/>`_.
    Required per test case data set size is **10** and for DPDK tests
    this is the actual size, as all scheduled test executions completed
    successfully.
