Release Notes
=============

Changes in |csit-release|
-------------------------

#. **DPDK performance tests**

   - *MRR tests* - Maximum Receive Rate tests measure the packet forwarding rate
     under the maximum load offered by traffic generator over a set trial
     duration, regardless of packet loss. MRR tests are used for continuous
     performance trending and for comparison between releases.

   - *MLR tests* - NDR and PDR tests measure the packet forwarding rate using
     MLRsearch library by traffic generator. All tests that previously used
     binary search were converted to MLRsearch.

   - *2-node tests* - Set of 2-node tests covering testpmd and l3fwd.

   - Increased coverage of NIC specific tests (Intel-xxv710-da2, Intel-x710)

   - *Generated tests* - Simplified and unified test structure,
     semi-autogenerated by generator script. Test generator is currently able
     to create test combinations with various frame size and cores combinations.
     All existing test cases were converted to new format.


Performance Changes
-------------------

Relative performance changes in measured packet throughput in |csit-release|
are calculated against the results from |csit-release-1|
report. Listed mean and standard deviation values are computed based on
a series of the same tests executed against respective DPDK releases to
verify test results repeatability, with percentage change calculated for
mean values.

NDR Changes

NDR throughput changes between releases are available in a CSV and pretty ASCII
formats:
