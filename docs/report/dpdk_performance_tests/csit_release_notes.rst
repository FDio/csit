Release Notes
=============

Changes in |csit-release|
-------------------------

#. **DPDK performance tests**

  - **MRR Throughput**: MRR (Maximum Receive Rate) test code has now
    configurable trial duration and number of consecutive executions.
    MRR tests are used for continuous performance trending and for
    comparison between VPP releases. In addition MRR code is used for
    initial phase of MLRsearch.

  - **MLRsearch Throughput**: MLRsearch algorithm has been introduced
    for all NDR and PDR throughput tests. All tests that previously
    used binary search got converted to MLRsearch. Coverage of NDR/PDR
    tests has been extended across more test scenarios.

  - **2-Node Tests**: A new set of 2-node tests covering DPDK Testpmd
    and L3fwd, running on new Xeon Skylake testbeds.

  - **More NICs**: Increased coverage of NIC models tested: Intel-
    xxv710-da2, Intel-x710-da4.

  - **Generated tests**: Simplified and unified test structure, semi-
    autogenerated by generator script. Test generator is currently
    able to create test combinations with various frame size and
    cores combinations. All existing test cases were converted to new
    format.

Performance Changes
-------------------

Relative performance changes in measured packet throughput in |csit-release|
are calculated against the results from |csit-release-1|
report. Listed mean and standard deviation values are computed based on
a series of the same tests executed against respective DPDK releases to
verify test results repeatability, with percentage change calculated for
mean values.

NDR Changes

NDR throughput changes between releases are available in a CSV and pretty ASCII
formats:
