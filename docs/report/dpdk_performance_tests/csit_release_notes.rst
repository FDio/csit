Release Notes
=============

Changes in |csit-release|
-------------------------

#. **DPDK performance tests**

   - *MRR tests* - Extended coverage of Maximum Receive Rate tests
     measure the packet forwarding rate under the maximum load offered
     by traffic generator over a set trial duration, regardless of packet loss.
     MRR tests are used for continuous performance trending and for comparison
     between releases.

   - *MLR tests* - NDR and PDR tests measure the packet forwarding rate using
     MLRsearch library by traffic generator. All tests that previously used
     binary search were converted to MLRsearch.

   - *2-node tests* - New set of 2-node tests covering testpmd and l3fwd.

   - Increased coverage of NIC specific tests (Intel-xxv710-da2, Intel-x710)

   - *Generated tests* - Simplified and unified test structure,
     semi-autogenerated by generator script. Test generator is currently able
     to create test combinations with various frame size and cores combinations.
     All existing test cases were converted to new format.

| 1 | Testpmd in 1t1c and 2t2c setups - large variation | CSIT-569   | Suspected NIC firmware or DPDK driver issue affecting NDR       |
|   | of discovered NDR throughput values across        |            | throughput. Applies to XL710 and X710 NICs, no issues observed  |
|   | multiple test runs with xl710 and x710 NICs.      |            | on x520 NICs.                                                   |
+---+---------------------------------------------------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2 | Lower than expected NDR throughput with xl710     | CSIT-571   | Suspected NIC firmware or DPDK driver issue affecting NDR       |
|   | and x710 NICs, compared to x520 NICs.             |            | throughput. Applies to XL710 and X710 NICs.                     |
