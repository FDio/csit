Release Notes
=============

Changes in |csit-release|
-------------------------

No code changes apart from bug fixes.

Performance Changes
-------------------

Relative performance changes in measured packet throughput in |csit-release|
are calculated against the results from |csit-release-1|
report. Listed mean and standard deviation values are computed based on
a series of the same tests executed against respective VPP releases to
verify test results repeatability, with percentage change calculated for
mean values. Note that the standard deviation is quite high for a small
number of packet throughput tests, what indicates poor test results
repeatability and makes the relative change of mean throughput value not
fully representative for these tests. The root causes behind poor
results repeatability vary between the test cases.

NDR Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

NDR throughput changes between releases are available in a
CSV and pretty ASCII formats:

  - `csv format for 1t1c <../_static/dpdk/performance-changes-1t1c-ndr.csv>`_,
  - `csv format for 2t2c <../_static/dpdk/performance-changes-2t2c-ndr.csv>`_,
  - `pretty ASCII format for 1t1c <../_static/dpdk/performance-changes-1t1c-ndr.txt>`_,
  - `pretty ASCII format for 2t2c <../_static/dpdk/performance-changes-2t2c-ndr.txt>`_.

are calculated against the results measured on 3-Node Hsw testbed.
