Release Notes
=============

Changes in |csit-release|
-------------------------

#. **DPDK release version change**

   - |csit-release| tested DPDK-18.05, as used by |vpp-release|.

#. **DPDK performance tests**

   - **MRR Throughput**: MRR (Maximum Receive Rate) test code has now
     configurable trial duration and number of consecutive executions.
     Coverage of MRR tests has been extended across more test
     scenarios. MRR tests are used for continuous performance trending.

   - **MLRsearch Throughput**: MLRsearch algorithm has been introduced
     for all NDR and PDR throughput tests. All tests that previously
     used binary search got converted to MLRsearch. Coverage of NDR/PDR
     tests has been extended across more test scenarios.

   - **2-Node Tests**: A new set of 2-node tests covering DPDK Testpmd
     and L3fwd, running on new Xeon Skylake testbeds.

   - **More NICs**: Increased coverage of NIC models tested: Intel-
     xxv710-da2, Intel-x710-da4.

   - **Generated tests**: Simplified and unified test structure, semi-
     autogenerated by generator script. Test generator is currently
     able to create test combinations with various frame size and
     cores combinations. All existing test cases were converted to new
     format.

#. **Presentation and Analytics Layer**

   - **Performance trending**: Added continuous performance trending with
     anomaly detection and analysis for DPDK.

Performance Changes
-------------------

Relative performance changes in measured NDR and PDR packet
throughput in |csit-release| are calculated against the test results
from |csit-release-1| report, for tests running on 3-Node Intel Xeon
Haswell testbeds (3n-hsw) in 1-core, 2-core and 4-core (MRR only)
configurations.

Listed mean and standard deviation values are computed based on a series
of the same tests executed against respective VPP releases to verify
test results repeatability, with percentage change calculated for mean
values.
