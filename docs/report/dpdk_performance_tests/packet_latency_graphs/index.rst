Packet Latency
==============

Plotted results are generated from a single execution of CSIT NDR discovery
test. Box plots are used to show the Minimum, Median and Maximum packet
latency per test.

*Title of each graph* is a regex (regular expression) matching all
throughput test cases plotted on this graph, *X-axis labels* are indices
of individual test suites executed by
`FD.io test executor dpdk performance jobs`_ that created result output file
used as data source for the graph, *Y-axis labels* are measured packet Latency
[uSec] values, and the *Graph legend* lists the plotted test suites and their
indices. Latency is reported for concurrent symmetric bi-directional flows,
separately for each direction: i) West-to-East:
TGint1-to-SUT1-to-SUT2-to-TGint2, and ii) East-to-West:
TGint2-to-SUT2-to-SUT1-to-TGint1.

.. note::

    Test results have been generated by
    `FD.io test executor dpdk performance jobs`_ with Robot Framework result
    files csit-dpdk-perf-\*.zip `archived here <../../_static/archive/>`_.
