IPv4 Routed-Forwarding
======================

This section includes summary graphs of L3FWD Phy-to-Phy performance with packet
routed forwarding measured at 50% of discovered NDR throughput rate. Latency is
reported for L3FWD running in multiple configurations of L3FWD pmd thread(s),
a.k.a. L3FWD data plane thread(s), and their physical CPU core(s) placement.

L3FWD packet latency - running in configuration of **one worker thread (1t) on one
physical core (1c)** - is presented in the figure below.

Testpmd packet latency - running in configuration of **two worker threads (2t)
on two physical cores (2c)** - is presented in the figure below.
