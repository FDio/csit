Tested Virtual Topologies
-------------------------

CSIT Honeycomb functional tests are executed on virtualized topologies created
using :abbr:`VIRL (Virtual Internet Routing Lab)` simulation platform
contributed by Cisco. VIRL runs on physical baremetal servers hosted by LF FD.io
project. All tests are executed in two node logical test topology - Traffic
Generator (TG) node and Systems Under Test (SUT1) node connected in a loop.
Logical test topology is shown in the figure below.::

SUT1 is a VM (Ubuntu or Centos, depending on the test suite), TG is a Traffic
Generator (TG, another Ubuntu VM). SUTs run Honeycomb and VPP SW applications
in Linux user-mode as a Device Under Test (DUT) within the VM. TG runs Scapy
SW application as a packet Traffic Generator. Logical connectivity between
SUTs and to TG is provided using virtual NICs using VMs' virtio driver.

Virtual testbeds are created on-demand whenever a verification job is started
(e.g. triggered by the gerrit patch submission) and destroyed upon completion
of all functional tests. Each node is a Virtual Machine and each connection
that is drawn on the diagram is available for use in any test case. During the
test execution, all nodes are reachable thru the Management network connected
to every node via dedicated virtual NICs and virtual links (not shown above
for clarity).

Total 219 Honeycomb functional tests in the |csit-release|.

Operational data in Honeycomb should mirror configuration data at all times.
Because of this, test cases follow this general pattern:

#. read operational data of the feature using restconf.
#. read status of the feature using VPP API dump.
#. modify configuration of the feature using restconf.
#. verify changes to operational data using restconf.
#. verify changes using VPP API dump, OR
#. send a packet to VPP node and observe behaviour to verify configuration.

Test cases involving network interfaces utilize the first two interfaces on
the DUT node.

Functional Tests Naming
-----------------------

|csit-release| introduced a common structured naming convention for all
performance and functional tests. This change was driven by substantially
growing number and type of CSIT test cases. Firstly, the original practice did
not always follow any strict naming convention. Secondly test names did not
always clearly capture tested packet encapsulations, and the actual type or
content of the tests. Thirdly HW configurations in terms of NICs, ports and
their locality were not captured either. These were but few reasons that drove
the decision to change and define a new more complete and stricter test naming
convention, and to apply this to all existing and new test cases.

The new naming should be intuitive for majority of the tests. The complete
description of CSIT test naming convention is provided on `CSIT test naming
page <https://wiki.fd.io/view/CSIT/csit-test-naming>`_.

Here few illustrative examples of the new naming usage for functional test
suites:

#. **Physical port to physical port - a.k.a. NIC-to-NIC, Phy-to-Phy, P2P**

   - *eth2p-ethip4-ip4base-func.robot* => 2 ports of Ethernet, IPv4 baseline
     routed forwarding, functional tests.

#. **Physical port to VM (or VM chain) to physical port - a.k.a. NIC2VM2NIC,
   P2V2P, NIC2VMchain2NIC, P2V2V2P**

   - *eth2p-ethip4vxlan-l2bdbasemaclrn-eth-2vhost-1vm-func.robot* => 2 ports of
     Ethernet, IPv4 VXLAN Ethernet, L2 bridge-domain switching to/from two vhost
     interfaces and one VM, functional tests.
