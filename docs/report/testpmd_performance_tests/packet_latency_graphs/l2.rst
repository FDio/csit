L2 Ethernet Interface Loop
==========================

This section includes summary graphs of Testpmd Phy-to-Phy packet
latency with L2 Ethernet Interface Loop measured at 50% of discovered
NDR throughput rate. Latency is reported for Testpmd running in multiple
configurations of Testpmd pmd thread(s), a.k.a. Testpmd data plane
thread(s), and their physical CPU core(s) placement.

Results are generated from a single execution of CSIT NDR discovery
test. Box plots are used to show the Minimum, Average and Maximum packet
latency per test.

*Title of each graph* is a regex (regular expression) matching all
throughput test cases plotted on this graph, *X-axis labels* are indices
of individual test suites executed by csit-dpdk-perf-1704-all job that
created result output file used as data source for the graph, *Y-axis
labels* are measured packet Latency [uSec] values, and the *Graph
legend* lists the plotted test suites and their indices. Latency is
reported for concurrent symmetric bi-directional flows, separately for
each direction: i) West-to-East: TGint1-to-SUT1-to-SUT2-to-TGint2, and
ii) East-to-West: TGint2-to-SUT2-to-SUT1-to-TGint1.

.. note::

    Test results have been generated by FD.io test executor jobs
    `csit-dpdk-perf-1704-all
    <https://jenkins.fd.io/view/csit/job/csit-dpdk-perf-1704-all/>`_,

Testpmd packet latency - running in configuration of **one worker thread (1t) on one
physical core (1c)** - is presented in the figure below.
