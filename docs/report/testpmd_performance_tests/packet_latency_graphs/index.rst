Packet Latency Graphs
=====================

Plotted results are generated from a single execution of CSIT NDR discovery
test. Box plots are used to show the Minimum, Median and Maximum packet
latency per test.

*Title of each graph* is a regex (regular expression) matching all
throughput test cases plotted on this graph, *X-axis labels* are indices
of individual test suites executed by csit-dpdk-perf-1704-all job that
created result output file used as data source for the graph, *Y-axis
labels* are measured packet Latency [uSec] values, and the *Graph
legend* lists the plotted test suites and their indices. Latency is
reported for concurrent symmetric bi-directional flows, separately for
each direction: i) West-to-East: TGint1-to-SUT1-to-SUT2-to-TGint2, and
ii) East-to-West: TGint2-to-SUT2-to-SUT1-to-TGint1.

.. note::

    Test results have been generated by FD.io test executor jobs
    `csit-dpdk-perf-1704-all
    <https://jenkins.fd.io/view/csit/job/csit-dpdk-perf-1704-all/>`_,
