Overview
========

TRex performance test results are reported for a range of processors.
For description of physical testbeds used for TRex performance tests
please refer to :ref:`tested_physical_topologies`.

Logical Topology
----------------

CSIT TRex performance tests are executed on physical testbeds described
in :ref:`tested_physical_topologies`. Logical topology use 1 nic that has
loopback connected ports. See figure below.

Performance Tests Coverage
--------------------------

Performance tests measure following metrics for tested TRex
topologies and configurations:

- Packet Throughput: measured in accordance with :rfc:`2544`, using
  FD.io CSIT Multiple Loss Ratio search (MLRsearch), an optimized binary
  search algorithm, producing throughput at different Packet Loss Ratio
  (PLR) values:

  - Non Drop Rate (NDR): packet throughput at PLR=0%.
  - Partial Drop Rate (PDR): packet throughput at PLR=0.5%.

- Two-way Packet Latency: measured both east-west and west-east at different
  offered packet loads:

  - 90% of discovered PDR throughput.
  - 50% of discovered PDR throughput.
  - 10% of discovered PDR throughput.
  - Minimal offered load.

|csit-release| includes tests using the following TRex traffic profiles
(corresponding to data plane functionality when DUT is used)
performance tested across a range of NIC drivers and NIC models:

+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Traffic profile       | Corresponding dataplane functionality        |
+=======================+==============================================+
| IPv4 Base             | IPv4 routing.                                |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| IPv4 Scale            | IPv4 routing with 2M entries.                |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| IPv6 Base             | IPv6 routing.                                |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| IPv6 Scale            | IPv6 routing with 2M entries.                |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| L2BD Scale            | L2 Bridge-Domain switching of untagged       |
|                       | Ethernet frames.                             |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------+


Performance Tests Naming
------------------------

FD.io |csit-release| follows a common structured naming convention for
all performance and system functional tests.

The naming should be intuitive for majority of the tests. Complete
description of FD.io CSIT test naming convention is provided on
:ref:`csit_test_naming`.
