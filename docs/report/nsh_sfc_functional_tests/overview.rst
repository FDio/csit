Overview
========

Virtual Topologies
------------------

CSIT NSH_SFC functional tests are executed in VM-based virtual topologies
created on demand using :abbr:`VIRL (Virtual Internet Routing Lab)`
simulation platform contributed by Cisco. VIRL runs on physical
baremetal servers hosted by LF FD.io project.

All tests are executed in three-node virtual test topology shown in the
figure below.

SUT1 and SUT2 are two VMs (running Ubuntu or Centos, depending on the
test suite), TG is a Traffic Generator (running Ubuntu VM). SUTs run VPP
with nsh-plugin in Linux user-mode as a Device Under Test (DUT) within
the VM. TG runs Scapy SW application as a packet Traffic Generator.
Network connectivity between SUTs and to TG is provided using virtual
NICs and VMs' virtio drivers.

Functional Tests Coverage
-------------------------

|csit-release| includes following NSH_SFC functionality tested in
virtual VM environment:

| NSH SFC Proxy         | TG sends some VXLAN encapsulated packets to  |
| Outbound              | test NSH SFC Proxy Outbound functional. DUT1 |
|                       | will receive these packets from one NIC and  |

| Function Forward      | encapsulated packets to test NSH SFC Service |
|                       | Function Forward functional. DUT1 will       |
