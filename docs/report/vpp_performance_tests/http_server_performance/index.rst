HTTP/TCP Performance
====================

Plotted results are generated by multiple executions of the same CSIT
performance tests across three physical testbeds within LF FD.io labs.
To provide a descriptive summary view, Box-and-Whisker plots are used to
display variation in measured performance values, without making any
assumptions of the underlying statistical distribution.

For each plotted test case, Box-and-Whisker plots show the quartiles
(Min, 1st quartile / 25th percentile, 2nd quartile / 50th percentile /
mean, 3rd quartile / 75th percentile, Max) across collected data set
(data set size stated in the note below). Outliers are plotted as
individual points. Min and max values are plotted as bottom and top
Whiskers respectively. 2nd and 3rd quartiles are plotted as bottom and
top edge of the box. If multiple samples match only two values, and all
samples fall between them, then no whiskers are plotted. If all samples
have the same value, only a horizontal line is plotted.

.. note::

    Data sources for reported test results: i) `FD.io test executor vpp
    performance job 3n-hsw`_, ii) archived FD.io jobs test result `output files
    <../../_static/archive/>`_.

    CSIT source code for the test cases used for plots can be found in
    `CSIT git repository <https://git.fd.io/csit/tree/tests/vpp/perf/tcp?h=rls1807>`_.
