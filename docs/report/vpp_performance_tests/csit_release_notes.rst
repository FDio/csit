CSIT Release Notes
==================

Changes in CSIT |release|
-------------------------

#. Test environment changes in VPP data plane performance tests:

   - Further characterization and optimizations of VPP vhost-user and VM test
     methodology and test environment;

     - Tests with varying Qemu virtio queue (a.k.a. vring) sizes:
       [vr256] default 256 descriptors, [vr1024] 1024 descriptors to
       optimize for packet throughput;

     - Tests with varying Linux :abbr:`CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler)`
       settings: [cfs] default settings, [cfsrr1] :abbr:`CFS (Completely Fair
       Scheduler)` RoundRobin(1) policy applied to all data plane threads
       handling test packet path including all VPP worker threads and all Qemu
       testpmd poll-mode threads;

     - Resulting test cases are all combinations with [vr256,vr1024] and
       [cfs,cfsrr1] settings;

     - For more detail see performance results observations section in
       this report;

#. Code updates and optimizations in CSIT performance framework:

   - Complete CSIT framework code revision and optimizations as descried
     on CSIT wiki page `Design_Optimizations
     <https://wiki.fd.io/view/CSIT/Design_Optimizations>`_.

   - For more detail see the :ref:`CSIT Framework Design <csit-design>` section
     in this report;

#. Changes to CSIT driver for TRex Traffic Generator:

   - Complete refactor of TRex CSIT driver;

   - Introduction of packet traffic profiles to improve usability and
     manageability of traffic profiles for a growing number of test
     scenarios.

   - Support for packet traffic profiles to test IPv4/IPv6 stateful and
     stateless DUT data plane features;

#. Added VPP performance tests

   - **Linux Container VPP memif virtual interface tests**

     - VPP Memif virtual interface (shared memory interface) tests
       interconnecting VPP instances over memif. VPP vswitch
       instance runs in bare-metal user-mode handling Intel x520 NIC
       10GbE interfaces and connecting over memif (Master side) virtual
       interfaces to another instance of VPP running in bare-metal Linux
       Container (LXC) with memif virtual interfaces (Slave side). LXC
       runs in a priviliged mode with VPP data plane worker threads
       pinned to dedicated physical CPU cores per usual CSIT practice.
       Both VPP run the same version of software. This test topology is
       equivalent to existing tests with vhost-user and VMs.

   - **Stateful Security Groups**

     - New tests of VPP stateful security-groups a.k.a. acl-plugin
       functionally compatible with networking-vpp OpenStack;

     - New tested security-groups access-control-lists (acl)
       configuration variants include: [iaclNsl] input acl stateless,
       [oaclNsl] output acl stateless, [iaclNsf] input acl stateful
       a.k.a. reflect, [oaclNsf] output acl stateful a.k.a. reflect,
       where N is number of access-control-entries (ace) in the acl.

     - Testing packet flows transmitted by TG: 100, 10k, 100k, always
       hitting the last permit entry in acl.

   - **VPP vhost and VM tests**

     - New VPP vhost-user and VM test cases to benchmark performance of
       VPP and VM topologies with Qemu and CFS policy combinations of
       [vr256,vr1024] x [cfs,cfsrr1];

     - Statistical analysis of repeatibility of results;

Performance Improvements
------------------------

Substantial improvements in measured packet throughput have been observed in a
number of CSIT |release| tests listed below, with relative increase of
double-digit percentage points. Relative improvements for this release are
calculated against the test results listed in CSIT |release-1| report. The
comparison is calculated between the mean values based on collected and
archived test results' samples for involved VPP releases. Standard deviation
has been also listed for CSIT |release|. VPP-16.09 and VPP-17.01 numbers are
provided for reference.
