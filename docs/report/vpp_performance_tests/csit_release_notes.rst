CSIT Release Notes
==================

Changes in CSIT |release|
-------------------------

#. Added VPP performance tests

   - **Container Service Chain Topologies Orchestrated by K8s with VPP Memif**

     - Added tests with VPP vswitch in container connecting a number of VPP-
       in-container service chain topologies with L2 Cross-Connect and L2
       Bridge-Domain configurations, orchestrated by Kubernetes. Added
       following forwarding topologies: i) "Parallel" with packets flowing from
       NIC via VPP to container and back to VPP and NIC; ii) "Chained" (a.k.a.
       "Snake") with packets flowing via VPP to container, back to VPP, to next
       container, back to VPP and so on until the last container in a chain,
       then back to VPP and NIC; iii) "Horizontal" with packets flowing via VPP
       to container, then via "horizontal" memif to next container, and so on
       until the last container, then back to VPP and NIC;

   - **VPP TCP/IP stack**

     - Added tests for VPP TCP/IP stack using VPP built-in HTTP server.
       WRK traffic generator is used as a client-side;

   - **SRv6**

     - Initial SRv6 (Segment Routing IPv6) tests verifying performance of
       IPv6 and SRH (Segment Routing Header) encapsulation, decapsulation,
       lookups and rewrites based on configured End and End.DX6 SRv6 egress
       functions;

   - **IPSecSW**

     - SW computed IPSec encryption with AES-GCM, CBC-SHA1 ciphers, in
       combination with IPv4 routed-forwarding;

#. Presentation and Analytics Layer

     - Added throughput speedup analysis for multi-core and multi-thread
       VPP tests into Presentation and Analytics Layer (PAL) for automated
       CSIT test results analysis;

#. Other changes

     - **Framework optimizations**

       - Ability to run CSIT framework on ARM architecture;

       - Overall stability improvements;

     - **NDR and PDR throughput binary search change**

       - Increased binary search resolution by reducing final step from
         100kpps to 50kpps;

     - **VPP plugin loaded as needed by tests**

       - From this release only plugins required by tests are loaded at
         VPP initialization time. Previously all plugins were loaded for
         all tests;

Performance Changes
-------------------

Relative performance changes in measured packet throughput in CSIT
|release| are calculated against the results from CSIT |release-1|
report. Listed mean and standard deviation values are computed based on
a series of the same tests executed against respective VPP releases to
verify test results repeatibility, with percentage change calculated for
mean values. Note that the standard deviation is quite high for a small
number of packet throughput tests, what indicates poor test results
repeatability and makes the relative change of mean throughput value not
fully representative for these tests. The root causes behind poor
results repeatibility vary between the test cases.
