CSIT Release Notes
==================

Changes in CSIT |release|
-------------------------

#. **VPP performance tests**

   - *MRR tests* - New Maximum Receive Rate tests measure the packet
     forwarding rate under the maximum load offered by traffic
     generator over a set trial duration, regardless of packet loss.
     MRR tests are used for continuous performance trending and for
     comparison between releases.

   - *Service Chaining with SRv6* - New SRv6 (Segment Routing IPv6) proxy
     tests measure performance of SRv6 Endpoint fronting SR-unaware
     appliance via masquerading (End.AM), dynamic proxy (End.AD) or
     static proxy (End.AS) SR functions.

#. **Presentation and Analytics Layer**

   - *Performance trending* - Added continuous performance trending and
     analysis. New Performance Trending and Performance Analysis jobs
     executed regular throughput tests, with results being subsequently
     analysed and trend and anomalies summarized and presented in VPP
     Performance Dashboard and trendline graphs.

#. **Test Framework Optimizations**

   - *Performance tests efficiency* - Qemu build/install optimizations,
     warmup phase handling, vpp restart handling. Resulted in improved
     stability and reduced total execution time by 30% for single pkt
     size e.g. 64B/78B.

   - *General code housekeeping* - ongoing RF keywords optimizations,
     removal of redundant RF keywords.

Performance Changes
-------------------

Relative performance changes in measured packet throughput in CSIT
|release| are calculated against the results from CSIT |release-1|
report. Listed mean and standard deviation values are computed based on
a series of the same tests executed against respective VPP releases to
verify test results repeatibility, with percentage change calculated for
mean values. Note that the standard deviation is quite high for a small
number of packet throughput tests, what indicates poor test results
repeatability and makes the relative change of mean throughput value not
fully representative for these tests. The root causes behind poor
results repeatibility vary between the test cases.

Throughput Trending
-------------------

In addition to reporting throughput changes between VPP releases, CSIT
provides continuous performance trending for VPP master branch:

#. `VPP Performance Dashboard <https://docs.fd.io/csit/master/trending/introduction/index.html>`_
   - per VPP test case throughput trend, trend compliance and summary of
   detected anomalies.

#. `Trending Methodology <https://docs.fd.io/csit/master/trending/methodology/index.html>`_
   - throughput test metrics, trend calculations and anomaly
   classification (progression, regression, outlier).

#. `Trendline Graphs <https://docs.fd.io/csit/master/trending/trending/index.html>`_
   - per VPP build MRR throughput measurements against the trendline
   with anomaly highlights, with associated CSIT test jobs.
