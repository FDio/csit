Release Notes
=============

Changes in |csit-release|
-------------------------

#. **VPP Performance Tests**

  - **MRR Throughput**: MRR (Maximum Receive Rate) test code has now
    configurable trial duration and number of consecutive executions.
    Coverage of MRR tests has been extended across more test
    scenarios. MRR tests are used for continuous performance trending
    and for comparison between VPP releases.

  - **MLRsearch Throughput**: MLRsearch algorithm has been introduced
    for all NDR and PDR throughput tests. All tests that previously
    used binary search got converted to MLRsearch. Coverage of NDR/PDR
    tests has been extended across more test scenarios.

  - **L2patch Tests**: Tests measure performance of VPP L2patch, the
    fastest L2 forwarding path implemented in VPP, that cross-links
    RX and TX of two physical interfaces.

  - **2-Node Tests**: A new baseline set of 2-node tests covering base
    ip4, ip6, l2patch, l2bd, l2xc, running on new Xeon Skylake
    testbeds.

  - **Generated tests**: Simplified and unified test structure, semi-
    autogenerated by generator script. Test generator is currently
    able to create test combinations with various frame size and
    cores combinations. All existing test cases were converted to new
    format.

  - **Simultaneous Multi-Threading**: SMT-aware detection of server
    processor operation mode (HyperThreading enabled/disabled) with
    associated compute resource configuration including thread
    affinity, number of Rx queues and DPDK I/O mbufs. Tests are
    automatically tagged during execution to indicate executed thread
    configuration.

  - **Intel Xeon Skylake Support**: Support for 2-Node and 3-Node
    physical testbed topologies based on the new SuperMirco servers
    each with two Intel Xeon Skylake Platinum processors. Full
    Ansible playbooks refactor for quick server (re)installation and
    reference pointers of configuration.

#. **Presentation and Analytics Layer**

  - **Performance trending**: Further improved continuous performance
    trending with anomaly detection and analysis.

#. **Test Framework Optimizations**

  - **General Code Housekeeping**: Ongoing RF keywords optimizations,
    removal of redundant RF keywords.

Performance Changes
-------------------

Relative performance changes in measured packet throughput in |csit-release|
are calculated against the results from |csit-release-1|
report. Listed mean and standard deviation values are computed based on
a series of the same tests executed against respective VPP releases to
verify test results repeatability, with percentage change calculated for
mean values. Note that the standard deviation is quite high for a small
number of packet throughput tests, what indicates poor test results
repeatability and makes the relative change of mean throughput value not
fully representative for these tests. The root causes behind poor
results repeatability vary between the test cases.

Throughput Trending
-------------------

In addition to reporting throughput changes between VPP releases, CSIT
provides continuous performance trending for VPP master branch:

#. `VPP Performance Dashboard <https://docs.fd.io/csit/master/trending/introduction/index.html>`_
   - per VPP test case throughput trend, trend compliance and summary of
   detected anomalies.

#. `Trending Methodology <https://docs.fd.io/csit/master/trending/methodology/index.html>`_
   - throughput test metrics, trend calculations and anomaly
   classification (progression, regression, outlier).

#. `Trendline Graphs <https://docs.fd.io/csit/master/trending/trending/index.html>`_
   - per VPP build MRR throughput measurements against the trendline
   with anomaly highlights, with associated CSIT test jobs.
