Release Notes
=============

Changes in |csit-release|
-------------------------

#. VPP PERFORMANCE TESTS

   - **Intel Xeon 2n-skx, 3n-skx and 2n-clx testbeds**: VPP test data is
     not included in this report version. This is due to performance
     and behaviour inconsistency following the upgrade to the latest
     Ubuntu 18.04 LTS kernel version (4.15.0-72-generic) and
     associated microcode packages (skx ucode 0x2000064, clx ucode
     0x500002c). Test data will be added in subsequent maintenance
     report version(s) once the issue is resolved. See
     :ref:`vpp_known_issues`.

   - **Service density 2n-skx tests**: Added new NF density tests with
     IPsec encryption between DUTs.

   - **AVF tests**: Full test coveraged based on code changes in CSIT core
     layer (driver/interface awareness) and generated by suite generator
     (Intel Fortville NICs only).

   - **Hoststack TCP/IP tests**: Major refactor of VPP Hoststack TCP/IP
     performance tests using WRK generator talking to the VPP HTTP
     static server plugin measuring connections per second and
     requests per second. Added iperf3 tests with LDPreload.

   - **Latency HDRHistogram**: Added High Dynamic Range Histogram
     latency measurements based on the new capability in TRex traffic
     generator. HDRH latency data presented in latency packet
     percentile graphs and in detailed results tables.

   - **Mellanox MCX556A-EDAT tests**: Added tests with Mellanox
     ConnectX5-2p100GE NICs in 2n-clx testbeds using VPP native rdma
     driver.

   - **IPsec reconfiguration tests**: Added tests measuring the impact of IPsec
     tunnels creations and removals.

   - **Load Balancer tests**: Added VPP performance tests for Maglev,
     L3DSR (Direct Server Return), Layer 4 Load Balancing NAT Mode.

#. TEST FRAMEWORK

   - **CSIT Python3 support**: Full migration of CSIT from Python2.7 to
     Python3.6. This change includes library migration, PIP dependency upgrade,
     CSIT container images, infrastructure packages ugrade/installation.

   - **CSIT PAPI support**: Finished conversion of CSIT VAT L1 keywords
     to PAPI L1 KWs in CSIT using VPP Python bindings (VPP PAPI).
     Redesign of key components of PAPI Socket Executor and PAPI
     history. Due to issues with PAPI performance, VAT is still used
     in CSIT for all VPP scale tests. See known issues below.

   - **Test Suite Generator**: Added capability to generate suites for
     different drivers per NIC model including DPDK, AVF, RDMA.
     Extended coverage for all tests.

   - **General Code Housekeeping**: Ongoing RF keywords optimizations,
     removal of redundant RF keywords and aligning of suite/test
     setup/teardowns.


#. PRESENTATION AND ANALYTICS LAYER

   - **Graphs layout improvements**: Improved performance graphs layout
     for better readibility and maintenance: test grouping, axis
     labels, descriptions, other informative decoration.

   - **Latency graphs**: Min/Avg/Max group bar latency graphs are
     replaced with packet latency percentile distributon at different
     background packet loads based on TRex latency hdrhistogram
     measurements.

| 1  | `CSIT-570                               | Sporadic (1 in 200) NDR discovery test failures on x520. DPDK reporting rx-errors, indicating L1 issue.   |
|    | <https://jira.fd.io/browse/CSIT-570>`_  | Suspected issue with HW combination of X710-X520 in LF testbeds. Not observed outside of LF testbeds.     |

| 3  | `CSIT-1498                              | Memif tests are sporadically failing on initialization of memif connection.                               |
|    | <https://jira.fd.io/browse/CSIT-1498>`_ |                                                                                                           |

| 5  | `CSIT-1591                              | All CSIT scale tests can not use PAPI due to much slower performance compared to VAT/CLI (it takes much   |
|    | <https://jira.fd.io/browse/CSIT-1499>`_ | longer to program VPP). This needs to be addressed on the PAPI side.                                      |
