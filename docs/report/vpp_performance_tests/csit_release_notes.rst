Release Notes
=============

Changes in |csit-release|
-------------------------

#. **VPP performance tests**

   - *MRR tests* - Maximum Receive Rate tests measure the packet forwarding rate
     under the maximum load offered by traffic generator over a set trial
     duration, regardless of packet loss. MRR tests are used for continuous
     performance trending and for comparison between releases.

   - *MLR tests* - NDR and PDR tests measure the packet forwarding rate using
     MLRsearch library by traffic generator. All tests that previously used
     binary search were converted to MLRsearch.

   - *L2patch tests* - Tests measure performance of L2patch, cross linking
     RX and TX of two physical interfaces.

   - *2-node tests* - Baseline set of 2-node tests covering base ip4, ip4,
     l2patch, l2bd, l2xc.

   - *Generated tests* - Simplified and unified test structure,
     semi-autogenerated by generator script. Test generator is currently able
     to create test combinations with various frame size and cores combinations.
     All existing test cases were converted to new format.

   - *Simultaneous multithreading* - SMT-aware automatic detection and
     resource configuration including thread affinity, number of rx queues and
     DPDK I/O mbufs. Tests are automatically tagged during execution indicating
     configuration.

  - *Intel Skylake* - Topologies consisting of 2-node and 3-node using
    SuperMirco servers each equipped with two Intel Xeon Skylake Platinum
    processors.

#. **Presentation and Analytics Layer**

   - *Performance trending* - Added continuous performance trending and
     analysis. New Performance Trending and Performance Analysis jobs
     executed regular throughput tests, with results being subsequently
     analysed and trend and anomalies summarized and presented in VPP
     Performance Dashboard and trendline graphs.

#. **Test Framework Optimizations**

   - *Performance tests efficiency* - Qemu build/install optimizations,
     warmup phase handling, vpp restart handling. Resulted in improved
     stability and reduced total execution time by 30% for single pkt
     size e.g. 64B/78B.

   - *General code housekeeping* - ongoing RF keywords optimizations,
     removal of redundant RF keywords.

Performance Changes
-------------------

Relative performance changes in measured packet throughput in |csit-release|
are calculated against the results from |csit-release-1|
report. Listed mean and standard deviation values are computed based on
a series of the same tests executed against respective VPP releases to
verify test results repeatability, with percentage change calculated for
mean values. Note that the standard deviation is quite high for a small
number of packet throughput tests, what indicates poor test results
repeatability and makes the relative change of mean throughput value not
fully representative for these tests. The root causes behind poor
results repeatability vary between the test cases.

Throughput Trending
-------------------

In addition to reporting throughput changes between VPP releases, CSIT
provides continuous performance trending for VPP master branch:

#. `VPP Performance Dashboard <https://docs.fd.io/csit/master/trending/introduction/index.html>`_
   - per VPP test case throughput trend, trend compliance and summary of
   detected anomalies.

#. `Trending Methodology <https://docs.fd.io/csit/master/trending/methodology/index.html>`_
   - throughput test metrics, trend calculations and anomaly
   classification (progression, regression, outlier).

#. `Trendline Graphs <https://docs.fd.io/csit/master/trending/trending/index.html>`_
   - per VPP build MRR throughput measurements against the trendline
   with anomaly highlights, with associated CSIT test jobs.
