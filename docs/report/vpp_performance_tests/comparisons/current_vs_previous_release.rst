Current vs. Previous Release
----------------------------

Relative comparison of VPP packet throughput (NDR, PDR and MRR) between
|vpp-release| and |vpp-release-1| (measured for |csit-release| and
|csit-release-1| respectively) is calculated from results of tests
running on 2-node Intel Xeon Skylake (2n-skx), 3-node Intel Xeon Skylake
(3n-skx), 3-Node Intel Xeon Haswell (3n-hsw), 2-node Intel Atom Denverton
(2n-dnv), 3-node Intel Atom Denverton (3n-dnv), 3-node Arm TaiShan (3n-tsh)
testbeds, in 1-core, 2-core and 4-core (MRR only) configurations.

Listed mean and standard deviation values are computed based on a series
of the same tests executed against respective VPP releases to verify
test results repeatability, with percentage change calculated for mean
values. Note that the standard deviation is quite high for a small
number of packet throughput tests, what indicates poor test results
repeatability and makes the relative change of mean throughput value not
fully representative for these tests. The root causes behind poor
results repeatability vary between the test cases.
