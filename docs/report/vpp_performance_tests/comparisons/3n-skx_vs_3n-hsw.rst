|vpp-release| 3n-Skx vs. 3n-Hsw
-------------------------------

Relative VPP |vpp-release| performance comparison in measured NDR, PDR
and MRR packet throughput is calculated for tests executed on 3-Node
Skylake (3n-skx) and 3-Node Haswell (3n-hsw) physical testbed types in
1-core configurations.

NDR Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NDR comparison between testbed types is available in CSV and pretty
ASCII formats:

  - `CSV 1c NDR comparison <../_static/vpp/performance-compare-testbeds-3n-hsw-3n-skx-ndr.csv>`_,
  - `ASCII 1c NDR comparison <../_static/vpp/performance-compare-testbeds-3n-hsw-3n-skx-ndr.txt>`_.

.. note::
