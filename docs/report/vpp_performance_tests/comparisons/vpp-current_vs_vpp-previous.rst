|vpp-release| vs. |vpp-release-1|
---------------------------------

Relative VPP performance comparison in measured NDR, PDR and MRR packet
throughput in |csit-release| is calculated against the test results
from |csit-release-1| report, for tests running on 3-Node Intel Xeon
Haswell testbeds (3n-hsw) in 1-core, 2-core and 4-core (MRR only)
configurations.

Listed mean and standard deviation values are computed based on a series
of the same tests executed against respective VPP releases to verify
test results repeatability, with percentage change calculated for mean
values. Note that the standard deviation is quite high for a small
number of packet throughput tests, what indicates poor test results
repeatability and makes the relative change of mean throughput value not
fully representative for these tests. The root causes behind poor
results repeatability vary between the test cases.
