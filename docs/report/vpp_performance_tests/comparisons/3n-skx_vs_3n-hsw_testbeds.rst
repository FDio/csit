3n-Skx vs. 3n-Hsw Testbeds
--------------------------

Relative comparison of |vpp-release| packet throughput (NDR, PDR and
MRR) is calculated for the same tests executed on 3-Node Skylake (3n-
skx) and 3-Node Haswell (3n-hsw) physical testbed types, in 1-core,
2-core and 4-core configurations.

NDR Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NDR comparison between testbed types is available in CSV and pretty
ASCII formats:
