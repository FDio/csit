Test Environment
================

CSIT performance tests are executed on the three identical physical testbeds
hosted by :abbr:`LF (Linux Foundation)` for FD.io project. Each testbed
consists of two servers acting as Systems Under Test (SUT) and one server
acting as Traffic Generator (TG).

Server Specification and Configuration
--------------------------------------

Complete specification and configuration of compute servers used in CSIT
physical testbeds is maintained on wiki page `CSIT testbed - Server HW
Configuration (Haswell) <https://wiki.fd.io/view/CSIT/CSIT_LF_testbed>`_ and
`CSIT testbed - Server HW Configuration (Skylake/ARM)
