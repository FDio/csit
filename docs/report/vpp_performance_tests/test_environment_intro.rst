CSIT performance tests are executed on the three identical physical testbeds
hosted by :abbr:`LF (Linux Foundation)` for FD.io project. Each testbed
consists of two servers acting as Systems Under Test (SUT) and one server
acting as Traffic Generator (TG).

Complete specification and configuration of compute servers used in CSIT
physical testbeds is maintained on wiki page `CSIT LF Testbeds
