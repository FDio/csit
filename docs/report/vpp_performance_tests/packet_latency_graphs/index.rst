.. _VPP_Packet_Latency:

Packet Latency
==============

Latency results are generated from a single execution of NDR discovery
test across physical testbeds hosted LF FD.io labs: 3n-hsw, 2n-skx, 2n-
skx. Box plots are used to show the Minimum, Median and Maximum packet
latency per test.

Additional information about graph data:

#. **Graph Title**: describes tested packet path, testbed topology,
   processor model, NIC model, packet size, number of cores and
   threads used by data plane workers and indication of DUT
   configuration.

#. **X-axis Labels**: indices of individual test suites as listed in
   Graph Legend and direction of latency flow:

   - West-to-East: TGint1-to-SUT1-to-SUT2-to-TGint2.
   - East-to-West: TGint2-to-SUT2-to-SUT1-to-TGint1.

#. **Y-axis Labels**: measured packet latency values in [uSec].

#. **Graph Legend**: lists X-axis indices with associated CSIT test
   suites executed to generate graphed test results.

#. **Hover Information**: lists number of runs executed, specific test
   substring, packet flow direction, maximal, mean and minimal values of
   measured latencies.

.. note::

    Test results have been generated by
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 3n-hsw`_,
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 3n-skx`_ and
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 2n-skx`_ with RF
