Tested Physical Topologies
--------------------------

CSIT VPP performance tests are executed on physical baremetal servers hosted by
:abbr:`LF (Linux Foundation)` FD.io project. Testbed physical topology is shown
in the figure below.::

              |                  +-----------+                  |
              |                  |           |                  |
              +------------------>    TG     <------------------+
                                 |           |
                                 +-----------+

SUT1 and SUT2 are two System Under Test servers (Cisco UCS C240, each with two
Intel XEON CPUs), TG is a Traffic Generator (TG, another Cisco UCS C240, with
two Intel XEON CPUs). SUTs run VPP SW application in Linux user-mode as a
Device Under Test (DUT). TG runs TRex SW application as a packet Traffic
Generator. Physical connectivity between SUTs and to TG is provided using
different NIC models that need to be tested for performance. Currently
installed and tested NIC models include:

#. 2port10GE X520-DA2 Intel.
#. 2port10GE X710 Intel.
#. 2port10GE VIC1227 Cisco.
#. 2port40GE VIC1385 Cisco.
#. 2port40GE XL710 Intel.

From SUT and DUT perspective, all performance tests involve forwarding packets
between two physical Ethernet ports (10GE or 40GE). Due to the number of
listed NIC models tested and available PCI slot capacity in SUT servers, in
all of the above cases both physical ports are located on the same NIC. In
some test cases this results in measured packet throughput being limited not
by VPP DUT but by either the physical interface or the NIC capacity.

Going forward CSIT project will be looking to add more hardware into FD.io
performance labs to address larger scale multi-interface and multi-NIC
performance testing scenarios.

For service chain topology test cases that require DUT (VPP) to communicate with
VirtualMachines (VMs) or with Linux/Docker Containers (Ctrs) over
vhost-user/memif interfaces, N of VM/Ctr instances are created on SUT1
and SUT2. Three types of service chain topologies are tested in CSIT |release|:

#. "Parallel" topology with packets flowing from NIC via DUT (VPP) to
   VM/Container and back to VPP and NIC;

#. "Chained" topology (a.k.a. "Snake") with packets flowing via DUT (VPP) to
   VM/Container, back to DUT, then to the next VM/Container, back to DUT and
   so on until the last VM/Container in a chain, then back to DUT and NIC;

#. "Horizontal" topology with packets flowing via DUT (VPP) to Container,
   then via "horizontal" memif to the next Container, and so on until the
   last Container, then back to DUT and NIC. "Horizontal" topology is not
   supported for VMs;

For each of the above topologies, DUT (VPP) is tested in a range of L2
or IPv4/IPv6 configurations depending on the test suite. A sample DUT
"Chained" service topology with N of VM/Ctr instances is shown in the
figure below. Packet flow thru the DUTs and VMs/Ctrs is marked with
``***``::

In above "Chained" topology, packets are switched by DUT multiple times:
twice for a single VM/Ctr, three times for two VMs/Ctrs, N+1 times for N
VMs/Ctrs. Hence the external throughput rates measured by TG and listed
in this report must be multiplied by (N+1) to represent the actual DUT
aggregate packet forwarding rate.

For a "Parallel" and "Horizontal" service topologies packets are always
switched by DUT twice per service chain.

Note that reported DUT (VPP) performance results are specific to the SUTs
tested. Current :abbr:`LF (Linux Foundation)` FD.io SUTs are based on Intel
XEON E5-2699v3 2.3GHz CPUs. SUTs with other CPUs are likely to yield different
results. A good rule of thumb, that can be applied to estimate VPP packet
thoughput for Phy-to-Phy (NIC-to-NIC, PCI-to-PCI) topology, is to expect
the forwarding performance to be proportional to CPU core frequency,
assuming CPU is the only limiting factor and all other SUT parameters
equivalent to FD.io CSIT environment. The same rule of thumb can be also
applied for Phy-to-VM/Ctr-to-Phy (NIC-to-VM/Ctr-to-NIC) topology, but due to
much higher dependency on intensive memory operations and sensitivity to Linux
kernel scheduler settings and behaviour, this estimation may not always yield
good enough accuracy.

For detailed FD.io CSIT testbed specification and topology, as well as
configuration and setup of SUTs and DUTs testbeds please refer to
:ref:`test_environment`.

Similar SUT compute node can be arrived to in a standalone VPP setup by using a
`vpp-config configuration tool
<https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP/Configuration_Tool>`_ developed within the
VPP project using CSIT recommended settings and scripts.

Performance Tests Coverage
--------------------------

Performance tests are split into two main categories:

- Throughput discovery - discovery of packet forwarding rate using binary search
  in accordance to :rfc:`2544`.

  - NDR - discovery of Non Drop Rate packet throughput, at zero packet loss;
    followed by one-way packet latency measurements at 10%, 50% and 100% of
    discovered NDR throughput.
  - PDR - discovery of Partial Drop Rate, with specified non-zero packet loss
    currently set to 0.5%; followed by one-way packet latency measurements at
    100% of discovered PDR throughput.

Execution of performance tests takes time, especially the throughput discovery
tests. Due to limited HW testbed resources available within FD.io labs hosted
by :abbr:`LF (Linux Foundation)`, the number of tests for NICs other than X520
(a.k.a. Niantic) has been limited to few baseline tests. CSIT team expect the
HW testbed resources to grow over time, so that complete set of performance
tests can be regularly and(or) continuously executed against all models of
hardware present in FD.io labs.

Performance Tests Naming
------------------------

CSIT |release| follows a common structured naming convention for all performance
and system functional tests, introduced in CSIT rls1701.

The naming should be intuitive for majority of the tests. Complete description
of CSIT test naming convention is provided on :ref:`csit_test_naming`.
