Packet Throughput
=================

Throughput graphs are generated by multiple executions of the same
performance tests across physical testbeds hosted LF FD.io labs: 3n-hsw,
2n-skx, 2n-skx. Box-and-Whisker plots are used to display variations in
measured throughput values, without making any assumptions of the
underlying statistical distribution.

For each test case, Box-and-Whisker plots show the quartiles (Min, 1st
quartile / 25th percentile, 2nd quartile / 50th percentile / mean, 3rd
quartile / 75th percentile, Max) across collected data set. Outliers are
plotted as individual points.

Additional information about graph data:

#. **Graph Title**: describes tested packet path, testbed topology,
   processor model, NIC model, packet size, number of cores and
   threads used by data plane workers and indication of VPP DUT
   configuration.

#. **X-axis Labels**: indices of individual test suites as listed in
   Graph Legend.

#. **Y-axis Labels**: measured Packets Per Second [pps] throughput
   values.

#. **Graph Legend**: lists X-axis indices with associated CSIT test
   suites executed to generate graphed test results.


.. note::

    Test results have been generated by
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 3n-hsw`_,
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 3n-skx`_ and
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 2n-skx`_ with RF
    result files csit-vpp-perf-|srelease|-\*.zip
    `archived here <../../_static/archive/>`_.
    Required per test case data set size is **10**, but for VPP tests
    the actual size varies per test case and is <=10.
