===========================

Following sections include Throughput Speedup Analysis for VPP multi-
core multi-thread configurations with no Hyper-Threading, specifically
for tested 2t2c (2threads, 2cores) and 4t4c scenarios. 1t1c throughput
results are used as a reference for reported speedup ratio.
Performance is reported for VPP
running in multiple configurations of VPP worker thread(s), a.k.a. VPP
data plane thread(s), and their physical CPU core(s) placement.
