Speedup Multi-Core
==================

Throughput Speedup Multi-Core graphs are generated based on results from
multiple executions of the same CSIT performance tests across the three
physical testbeds within LF FD.io labs. Plotted grouped bars illustrate
the 64B/78B packet throughput speedup ratio for 2- and 4-core multi-
threaded VPP configurations relative to 1-core configurations.

.. note::

    Test results have been generated by
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 3n-hsw`_,
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 3n-skx`_ and
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 2n-skx`_ with Robot Framework
    result files csit-vpp-perf-|srelease|-\*.zip
    `archived here <../../_static/archive/>`_.
    Plotted data set size per test case is equal to the number of job executions
    presented in this report version: **10**.
