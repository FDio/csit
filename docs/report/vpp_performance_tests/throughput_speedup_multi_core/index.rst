Speedup Multi-Core
==================

Speedup Multi-Core throughput graphs are generated by multiple
executions of the same performance tests across physical testbeds hosted
LF FD.io labs: 3n-hsw, 2n-skx, 2n-skx. Grouped bars illustrate the
64B/78B packet throughput speedup ratio for 2- and 4-core multi-
threaded VPP configurations relative to 1-core configurations.

.. note::

    Test results have been generated by
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 3n-hsw`_,
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 3n-skx`_ and
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 2n-skx`_ with RF
    result files csit-vpp-perf-|srelease|-\*.zip
    `archived here <../../_static/archive/>`_.
    Required per test case data set size is **10**, but for VPP tests
    the actual size varies per test case and is <=10.
