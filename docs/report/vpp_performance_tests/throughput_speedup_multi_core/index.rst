Speedup Multi-Core
==================

Speedup Multi-Core throughput graphs are generated by multiple
executions of the same performance tests across physical testbeds hosted
LF FD.io labs: 2n-skx, 3n-skx, 2n-clx, 3n-tsh, 2n-tx2, 2n-dnv, 3n-dnv.
Grouped bars illustrate the 64B/78B packet throughput speedup ratio for
2- and 4-core multi-threaded VPP configurations relative to 1-core
configurations.

Additional information about graph data:

#. **Graph Title**: describes tested packet path, testbed topology,
   processor model, NIC model, packet size used by data plane workers and
   indication of VPP DUT configuration.

#. **X-axis Labels**: number of cores.

#. **Y-axis Labels**: measured Packets Per Second [pps] throughput
   values.

#. **Graph Legend**: lists CSIT test suites executed to generate graphed test
   results.

#. **Hover Information**: lists number of runs executed, specific test
   substring, mean value of the measured packet throughput, calculated perfect
   throughput value, difference between measured and perfect values and
   relative speedup value.

.. note::

    Test results are stored in
    `build logs from FD.io vpp performance job 2n-aws`_,
    `build logs from FD.io vpp performance job 2n-skx`_,
    `build logs from FD.io vpp performance job 3n-skx`_,
    `build logs from FD.io vpp performance job 2n-clx`_,
    `build logs from FD.io vpp performance job 2n-zn2`_,
    `build logs from FD.io vpp performance job 3n-tsh`_,
    `build logs from FD.io vpp performance job 2n-tx2`_,
    `build logs from FD.io vpp performance job 2n-dnv`_ and
    `build logs from FD.io vpp performance job 3n-dnv`_ with RF
    result files csit-vpp-perf-|srelease|-\*.zip
    `archived here <../../_static/archive/>`_.
    Required per test case data set size is **10**, but for VPP tests
    the actual size varies per test case and is <=10.
