L2 Ethernet Switching
=====================

Following sections include Throughput Speedup Analysis for VPP multi-
core multi-thread configurations with no Hyper-Threading, specifically
for tested 2t2c (2threads, 2cores) and 4t4c scenarios. 1t1c throughput
results are used as a reference for reported speedup ratio. Input data
used for the graphs comes from Phy-to-Phy 64B performance tests with VPP
L2 Ethernet switching, including NDR throughput (zero packet loss) and
PDR throughput (<0.5% packet loss).
