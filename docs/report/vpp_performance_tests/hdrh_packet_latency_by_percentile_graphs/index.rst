Latency by Percentile Distribution
==================================

Latency results are generated from a single execution of NDRPDR discovery
test across physical testbeds hosted LF FD.io labs: 3n-hsw, 2n-skx, 3n-
skx, 3n-tsh, 2n-clx.

.. note::

    Test results have been generated by
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 2n-skx`_,
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 3n-skx`_,
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 2n-skx`_,
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 3n-hsw`_ and
    `FD.io test executor vpp performance job 3n-tsh`_ with RF
    result files csit-vpp-perf-|srelease|-\*.zip
