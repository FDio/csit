NFV Service Density
===================

NFV Service Density is benchmarked in three distinct NF service
configurations:

- VNF Service Chains
- CNF Service Chains
- CNF Service Pipelines

Each configuration is tested in a number of service density combinations
[Number of Service Instances] x [Number of NFs per Service Instance].
The actual tested range is based on available CPU physical core
resources.
