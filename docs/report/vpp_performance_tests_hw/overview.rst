VPP Performance Test Topologies
-------------------------------

CSIT VPP performance tests are executed on physical baremetal servers hosted by LF
FD.io project. Testbed physical topology is shown in the figure below.::

SUT1 and SUT2 are two System Under Test servers (Cisco UCS C240, each with two
Intel XEON CPUs), TG is a Traffic Generator (TG, another Cisco UCS C240, with
two Intel XEON CPUs). SUTs run VPP SW application in Linux user-mode as a
Device Under Test (DUT). TG runs TRex SW application as a packet Traffic
Generator. Physical connectivity between SUTs and to TG is provided using
different NIC models that need to be tested for performance. Currently
installed and tested NIC models include:

#. 2port10GE X520-DA2 Intel.
#. 2port10GE X710 Intel.
#. 2port10GE VIC1227 Cisco.
#. 2port40GE VIC1385 Cisco.
#. 2port40GE XL710 Intel.

Detailed LF FD.io test bed specification and topology is described on `CSIT LF
testbed wiki page <https://wiki.fd.io/view/CSIT/CSIT_LF_testbed>`_.

For test cases that require DUT (VPP) to communicate with VM over vhost-user
interfaces, a VM is created on SUT1 and SUT2. DUT (VPP) test topology with VM
is shown in the figure below including applicable packet flow thru the VM
(marked with \*\*\*).::

Note that for VM tests, packets are switched by DUT (VPP) twice, hence the
throughput rates measured by TG must be multiplied by two to represent the
actual DUT packet forwarding rate.

VPP Performance Tests Overview
------------------------------

Performance tests are split into two main categories:

- Throughput discovery - discovery of packet forwarding rate using binary search
  in accordance to RFC2544.

  - NDR - discovery of Non Drop Rate, zero packet loss.
  - PDR - discovery of Partial Drop Rate, with specified non-zero packet loss.

- Throughput verification - verification of packet forwarding rate against
  previously discovered throughput rate. These tests are currently done against
  0.9 of reference NDR, with reference rates updated periodically.
