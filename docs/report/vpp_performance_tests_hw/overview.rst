CSIT VPP performance tests are executed on physical baremetal servers hosted by LF
FD.io project. Testbed physical topology is shown in the figure below.

SUT1 and SUT2 are two System Under Test servers (Cisco UCS C240, each with two
Intel XEON CPUs), TG is a Traffic Generator (TG, another Cisco UCS C240, with
two Intel XEON CPUs). SUTs run VPP SW application in Linux user-mode as a
Device Under Test (DUT). TG runs TRex SW application as a packet Traffic
Generator. Physical connectivity between SUTs and to TG is provided using
different NIC models that need to be tested for performance. Currently
installed and tested NIC models include:

#. 2port10GE X520-DA2 Intel.
#. 2port10GE X710 Intel.
#. 2port10GE VIC1227 Cisco.
#. 2port40GE VIC1385 Cisco.
#. 2port40GE XL710 Intel.

Detailed LF FD.io test bed specification and physical topology are described
in `wiki CSIT LF testbed <https://wiki.fd.io/view/CSIT/CSIT_LF_testbed>`_.

For test cases that require DUT (VPP) to communicate with VM over vhost-user
interfaces, a VM is created on SUT1 and SUT2. DUT (VPP) test topology with VM
is shown in the figure below including applicable packet flow thru the VM
(marked in the figure with ``***``).

Note that for VM tests, packets are switched by DUT (VPP) twice, hence the
throughput rates measured by TG (and listed in this report) must be multiplied
by two to represent the actual DUT aggregate packet forwarding rate.

VPP Performance Tests Overview
------------------------------

Performance tests are split into the two main categories:

- Throughput discovery - discovery of packet forwarding rate using binary search
  in accordance to RFC2544.

  - NDR - discovery of Non Drop Rate packet throughput, at zero packet loss;
    followed by packet one-way latency measurements at 10%, 50% and 100% of
    discovered NDR throughput.
  - PDR - discovery of Partial Drop Rate, with specified non-zero packet loss
    currently set to 0.5%; followed by packet one-way latency measurements at
    100% of discovered PDR throughput.

- Throughput verification - verification of packet forwarding rate against
  previously discovered throughput rate. These tests are currently done against
  0.9 of reference NDR, with reference rates updated periodically.

Execution of performance tests takes time, especially the throughput discovery
tests. Due to limited HW testbed resources available within FD.io labs hosted
by Linux Foundation, the number of tests for NICs other than X520 (a.k.a.
Niantic) has been limited to few baseline tests. Over time we expect the HW
testbed resources to grow, and will be adding complete set of performance
tests for all models of hardware to be executed regularly and(or)
continuously.
