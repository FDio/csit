VPP Functional Test Topologies in VIRL
--------------------------------------

CSIT VPP functional tests are executed on virtualized topologies created using
Virtual Internet Routing Lab (VIRL) simulation platform contributed by Cisco.
VIRL runs on physical baremetal servers hosted by LF FD.io project.  Majority
of the tests are executed in the three node logical test topology - Traffic
Generator (TG) node and two Systems Under Test (SUT) nodes connected in a
loop. Some tests use two node logical test topology - TG node and SUT node.
Both logical test topologies are shown in the figures below:::

Virtual testbeds are created dynamically whenever a verification job is
started triggered by the patch submission to gerrit and destroyed upon
completion of all functional tests. During test execution, all nodes are
reachable thru the MGMT network connected to every node via dedicated NICs and
links (not shown above for clarity). Each node is a Virtual Machine and each
connection that is drawn on the diagram is available for use in any test case.

For test cases that require DUT (VPP) to communicate with VM over vhost-user
interfaces, a nested VM is created on SUT1 and/or SUT2 for the duration of
that particular test case only. DUT (VPP) test topology with VM is shown in
the figure below including the applicable packet flow thru the VM (marked with
``*``).::
