Virtual Topologies
------------------

CSIT VPP functional tests are executed on virtualized topologies created using
:abbr:`VIRL (Virtual Internet Routing Lab)` simulation platform contributed by
Cisco. VIRL runs on physical baremetal servers hosted by LF FD.io project.
Based on the packet path thru server SUTs, two distinct logical topology types
are used for VPP DUT data plane testing:

#. NIC-to-NIC switching topologies.
#. VM service switching topologies.

NIC-to-NIC Switching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest logical topology for software data plane application like
VPP is NIC-to-NIC switching. Tested topologies for 2-Node and 3-Node
testbeds are shown in figures below.

SUT1 and SUT2 are two VMs (Ubuntu or Centos, depending on the test suite), TG
is a Traffic Generator (TG, another Ubuntu VM). SUTs run VPP SW application in
Linux user-mode as a Device Under Test (DUT) within the VM. TG runs Scapy SW
application as a packet Traffic Generator. Logical connectivity between SUTs
and to TG is provided using virtual NICs using VMs' virtio driver.

Virtual testbeds are created on-demand whenever a verification job is started
(e.g. triggered by the gerrit patch submission) and destroyed upon completion
of all functional tests. Each node is a Virtual Machine and each connection
that is drawn on the diagram is available for use in any test case. During the
test execution, all nodes are reachable thru the Management network connected
to every node via dedicated virtual NICs and virtual links (not shown above
for clarity).

VM Service Switching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VM service switching topology test cases require VPP DUT to communicate
with Virtual Machines (VMs) over vhost-user virtual interfaces. A nested VM is
created on SUT1 and/or SUT2 for the duration of these particular test cases
only. DUT (VPP) test topology with VM is shown in the figure below.

Functional Tests Naming
-----------------------

|csit-release| follows a common structured naming convention for all performance
and system functional tests, introduced in CSIT-17.01.

The naming should be intuitive for majority of the tests. Complete description
of CSIT test naming convention is provided on :ref:`csit_test_naming`.
