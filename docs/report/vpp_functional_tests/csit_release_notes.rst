| 1 | DHCPv4 client: Client responses to DHCPv4 OFFER | CSIT-129 | Client replies with DHCPv4 REQUEST message when      |
|   | sent with different XID.                        | VPP-99   | received DHCPv4 OFFER message with different (wrong) |
|   |                                                 |          | XID.                                                 |

| 2 | Softwire - MAP-E: Incorrect calculation of IPv6 | CSIT-398 | IPv6 destination address is wrongly calculated in    |
|   | destination address when IPv4 prefix is 0.      | VPP-380  | case that IPv4 prefix is equal to 0 and IPv6 prefix  |
|   |                                                 |          | is less than 40.                                     |

| 3 | Softwire - MAP-E: Map domain is created when    | CSIT-399 | Map domain is created in case that the sum of suffix |
|   | incorrect parameters provided.                  | VPP-435  | length of IPv4 prefix and PSID length is greater     |
|   |                                                 |          | than EA bits length. IPv6 destination address        |

| 4 | IPv6 RA: Incorrect IPv6 destination address in  | CSIT-409 | Wrong IPv6 destination address (ff02::1) is used in  |
|   | response to ICMPv6 Router Solicitation.         | VPP-406  | ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packet sent as a         |
