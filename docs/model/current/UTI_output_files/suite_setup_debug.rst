Suite setup, debug output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As robot suites are organized in directory tree structure,
there are several levels of suites.

This file contains outputs from suite setup at this level,
as a JSON mapping.

When the file is missing, it means this level of suite does not have a setup.

This file is intended to be downloaded infrequently by human investigators,
so it contains more debug information but less post-processing.

The file content consists of a single JSON mapping.
For explanation of its entries, see suite_setup_debug subdirectory.

Version
~~~~~~~

Suite setup files are present since version 0.2.0,
last patch update in version 0.2.0.
