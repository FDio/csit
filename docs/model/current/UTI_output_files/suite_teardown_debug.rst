Suite teardown, debug output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As robot suites are organized in directory tree structure,
there are several levels of suites.

This file contains outputs from suite teardown at this level.

When the file is missing, it means this level of suite does not have a teardown.

This file is intended to be downloaded infrequently by human investigators,
so it contains more debug information but less post-processing.

The file content consists of a single JSON mapping.
For explanation of its entries, see suite_teardown_debug subdirectory.

Version
~~~~~~~

Suite teardown files are present since version 0.2.0,
last patch update in version 0.2.0.
