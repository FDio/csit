Suite teardown
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As robot suites are organized in directory tree structure,
there are several levels of suites.

This file contains outputs from suite teardown at this level.

When a file is missing, it means this level of suite does not have a teardown.

The file content consists of a single JSON mapping.
For explanation of its entries, see suite_teardown subdirectory.
