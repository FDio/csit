Samples
^^^^^^^

Present when test type is "MRR".

Value of this entry is a list of floats.

Each item of the list is a receive rate for one MRR trial.
For rate unit, see "unit" entry.

Currently, the tests are exporting approximated receive rate.
That means the actual trial duration is measured
(as opposed to trusting traffic generator to honot its target duration),
so the resulting values contain noise from time measurement
and can be lower than the real performance (due to various time overheads).
