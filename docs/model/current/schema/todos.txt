Add a tox checker that runs yaml2json and fails if json schema file changes.
(Sometimes I forget to convert from yaml, this would detect that.)

Enhance version tox checker to look at all version copies:
Constants, top doc, schema.version, schema.url.

Export also tg_type and tg_version properties.

Add description with link to methodology for MRR, NDRPDR, SOAK and RECONF.

Add multiplicity field to MRR result, so PAL can detect incomplete samples.

Add link explaining our L1 bandwidth calculation.

Add a link to URL explaining how to decode the hdrh data.

Do we want to require more structure for dut_version, e.g. at least two dots?

Should we parse version strings?
E.g.: Turn dut_version from "21.11.0"
into {"major": 21, "minor": 11, "patch": 0}.
