+ Create pure throughput tests:
  + Experiment with "persistent sessions" (rampup instead reset) to get pure throughput tests.
    + Ramp-up for size-limited profiles: ignore duration.
  - Delays to separate connect, transfer and disconenct phases.
  + NAT44ed scenario where the outside source address and port is limited to just one value.
    + Would enable STL bidir test for NAT44ED.
    - May be prohibited by outside address+port selection logic in VPP
+ Use MSS to influence data packet size in TCP tests.
  + Either data size or expected packet count needs to be updated/computed.
- Tweak UDP burst size, maybe 64 could work.
- Change TCP data size from the current 11111 B.
+ Investigate whether latency can be made work with ASTF profiles.
  + If yes, enable.
- Support IMIX in ASTF profiles.
+ Investigate validity of traffic delay compensation constants on all platforms (min scale).
  + Report traffic delay to Trex devs.
+ Measure how duration stretching depends on TPS (and profile), graphs etc.
  + Report to Trex devs.
- Investigate quantitative impact of polling counters during traffic.
  - Report to Trex devs.
- Measure how L7 counters suffer depending on TPS (and profile).
  - Report to Trex devs.
+ Unify runtime trials (currently ASTF override the STL way).
+ Make VPP session timeouts configurable to avoid issues at big scales.
