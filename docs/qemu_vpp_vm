QEMU is used for VPP-VM testing enviroment. You need to run qemu-2.2.1 or newer
in order to Vhos-user support. In CSIT VIRL setup DUT has preinstalled QEMU and
contains small VM image "/var/lib/vm/vhost-nested.img". QEMU binary path must
be "/opt/qemu/bin/qemu-system-x86_64". You can use following script to replicate
QEMU setup on DUT "resources/libraries/bash/qemu_build.sh". VM image must have
installed at least qemu-guest-agent, sshd, bridge-utils and VirtIO support.
Note that VPP must be installed before starting the VM, because VPP will do the
hugepages configuration as part of it's installation process. Username/password
for the VM must be cisco/cisco and NOPASSWD sudo access. The interface naming is
based on driver (the management is of Intel E1000 type), all E1000 interfaces
will be named mgmt<n> and all VirtIO interfaces will be named virtio<n>.
In /etc/init.d/qemu-guest-agent you must set "TRANSPORT=isa-serial:/dev/ttyS1".
There is python library for QEMU setup, start and some utilities
"resources/libraries/python/QemuUtils.py" and keyword "Stop and Clear QEMU" for
teardown in resources/libraries/robot/qemu.robot.
Example usage in robot framework test:

*** Settings ***
| Resource | resources/libraries/robot/qemu.robot
| Library | resources.libraries.python.QemuUtils

*** Test Cases ***
| VM test
| | Qemu Set Node | ${nodes['DUT1']}
| | ${vm}= | Set Variable | ${None}
| | ${vm}= | Qemu Start
| | [Teardown] | Stop and Clear QEMU | ${dut1} | ${vm}

Note that VPP must be started and cofigured before starting the VM when using
Vhost-user interfaces.
