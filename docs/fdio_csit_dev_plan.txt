FD.io CSIT High-Level Development Plan
======================================

Proposed Work Organisation
--------------------------

* Each work area is covered by owners.
  - Technical Lead (TL) - overall responsibility incl. design, detailed
    work plan, DT coordination, managing dependencies.
  - Development Team (DT) - doing work following the TL.
  - Project Lead (PL) - involved in all work areas at higher level,
    focusing on requirements definitions, design and work reviews,
    acceptance.
  - For work areas with large number of deliverables there could be
    multiple TLs e.g. for operations, framework or test refactor.
  - FD.io CSIT owners' initials listed with suffix strings:
    "[TL;DT1..DTn;PL]", contact details at the end of this note.

* Actual work breakdown tracked in FD.io CSIT jira:
  - Tasks tracked in Jira under CSIT Epics.

Plan Timeline
-------------

* Current release cycle:
  - FD.io CSIT rls18.07, associated with VPP-18.07.
* Sub-sequent releases:
  - FD.io CSIT rls18.10, rls1812, ..
  - Work not completed fully in current release cycle marked as backlog
    for follow-on release(s).

    [TF;JG,PM,TF;MK]
  * Productize duration aware multi-rate MLR search. [VP;PM,VP;MK]
  * Improve continuous performance trending: anomaly detection tunings,
    add dpdk. [TF;TF,VP;MK]
  * Complete and phase into production continuous per VPP patch
    performance tests. [PM;PM,TF,VP;MK]
  * Implement proper per-packet latency measurements, reporting and
    analytics with TRex HdrHistogram. [TF;PM,TF,VP;MK]
  * Evolve presentation and analytics layer (PAL) addressing growing
