FD.io CSIT-CPL Development Plan
===============================

Proposed Organisation
---------------------

(I know it's fairly basic stuff as FD.io CSIT-CPL is still quite a small
team taking into account active contributors, but it should clarify
roles/responsibilities, especially when/if the team grows.)

* Each work area gets assigned roles/owners.
  - Technical Lead (TL) - overall responsibility incl. design, detailed
    work plan and estimates, DT coordination, managing dependencies.
  - Development Team (DT) - doing work following the TL.
  - Project Lead (PL) - involved in all work areas at higher level,
    focusing
    on requirements definitions, design and work reviews, acceptance.
  - For work areas with large number of deliverables there could be
    multiple TLs e.g. for operations, framework or test volume refactor.
  - Proposed owner markup with suffix strings: "[TL;DT1..DTn;PL]".

* Further work breakdown for each work area maintained in FD.io CSIT git
  repo:
  - Separate .txt (or .rst, .md) file per work area.
  - Updates subject to git reviews.
  - Keep it still abstract, that is avoid task level.
  - Tasks tracked in Jira, under Epics, CSIT-CPL Epics scheme to be
    reviewed.

Plan Timeline
-------------

* Current release cycle:
  - FD.io CSIT-CPL rls18.07, associated with VPP-18.07.
* Sub-sequent releases:
  - FD.io CSIT-CPL rls18.10, rls1812, ..
  - Work not completed fully in current release cycle to be addressed in
    follow-on release(s).

Plan Summary
------------

* Infrastructure, Framework, Tools
  * New Skylake testbed infra to increase FD.io CSIT-CPL lab capacity.
    [PM;EK,PM;MK]
  * Introduce 2-node performance tests for new Skylake testbed infra.
    [TF;JG,PM,TF;MK]
  * Productize duration aware multi-rate MLR search. [VP;PM,VP;MK]
  * Improve continuous performance trending: anomaly detection tunings,
    add dpdk. [TF;TF,VP;MK]
  * Complete and phase into production continuous per VPP patch
    performance tests. [PM;PM,TF,VP;MK]
  * Implement proper per-packet latency measurements, reporting and
    analytics with TRex HdrHistogram. [TF;PM,TF,VP;MK]
  * Evolve presentation and analytics layer (PAL) addressing the main
    weaknesses of current design in response to growing volumes of test
    measurement and telemetry data. [TF;EK,PM,TF,VP;MK]
  * Start migration from CSIT_VIRL to VPP_Paths (make_test) and
    VPP_Devices integration tests. [JG;EK,JG,TF;MK]
  * Continue to enhance CSIT-CPL reports and trending doc pages and
    supporting backend PAL and test code addressing wider set of data
    plane workloads and improving CI/CD trending communication to
    FD.io community. [TF;PM,TF,VP;MK]
  * Automate VPP performance regression search. [TF;TF,VP;MK]
  * Other refactor: VAT to PAPI, data driven tests, suite duration,
    infra overhead. [VP;JG,PM,TF,VP;MK]

* Testing, Performance
  * New tests: more TCP stack, SRv6, memif; AVF driver (no DPDK).
    [MK;JG,PM,TF,VP;MK]
  * VPP_Path: migration of P0 VIRL tests to VPP_matk_test, followed by
    qualification of VIRL P1, P2 tests; adding use case driven
    functional tests.
  * VPP_Device: new use cases per VPP_Device design note <add link>.
  * VPP_Path_Device: continue to add relevant tests.

* Support, Community
  * FD.io Operations. [All]
  * FD.io CSIT-CPL community. [All]
  * ARM, Atom servers. [?]

* Collaboration, Communication
  * API changes across VPP major versions. [?]
  * Plugin dependencies. [?]
  * DPDK driver dependencies. [?]
