Description
===========

Performance dashboard tables provide the latest VPP throughput trend,
trend compliance and detected anomalies, all on a per VPP test case
basis.  Linked trendline graphs enable further drill-down into the
trendline compliance, sequence and nature of anomalies, as well as
pointers to performance test builds/logs and VPP (or DPDK) builds.
Performance trending is currently based on the Maximum Receive Rate (MRR) tests.
MRR tests measure the packet forwarding rate under the maximum load offered
by traffic generator over a set trial duration, regardless of packet
loss. See :ref:`trending_methodology` section for more detail including
trend and anomaly calculations.

Data samples are generated by the CSIT VPP (and DPDK) performance trending jobs
executed twice a day (target start: every 12 hrs, 02:00, 14:00 UTC). All
trend and anomaly evaluation is based on an algorithm which divides test runs
into groups according to minimum description length principle.
The trend value is the population average of the results within a group.

Tested VPP worker-thread-core combinations (1t1c, 2t1c, 2t2c, 4t2c, 4t4c, 8t4c)
are listed in separate tables in section 1.x. Followed by trending methodology
in section 2. and trending graphs in sections 3.x. Performance test  data
used for trending graphs is provided in sections 4.x.
