VPP Performance Dashboard
=========================

Description
-----------

Performance dashboard tables provide the latest VPP throughput trend,
trend compliance and detected anomalies, all on a per VPP test case
basis.  Linked trendline graphs enable further drill-down into the
trendline compliance, sequence and nature of anomalies, as well as
pointers to performance test builds/logs and VPP builds.

Performance trending is currently based on the Maximum Receive Rate
(MRR) tests. MRR tests measure the packet forwarding rate under the
maximum load offered by traffic generator over a set trial duration,
regardless of packet loss. See :ref:`trending_methodology` section for
more detail including trend and anomaly calculations.

Data samples are generated by the CSIT VPP performance trending jobs
executed twice a day (target start: every 12 hrs, 02:00, 14:00 UTC). All
trend and anomaly evaluation is based on a rolling window of <N=14> data
samples, covering last 7 days.

Legend to table:

    - **Test Case** : name of FD.io CSIT test case, naming convention
      `here <https://wiki.fd.io/view/CSIT/csit-test-naming>`_.
    - **Trend [Mpps]** : last value of performance trend.
    - **Short-Term Change [%]** : Relative change of last trend value
      vs. last week trend value.
    - **Long-Term Change [%]** : Relative change of last trend value vs.
      maximum of trend values over the last quarter except last week.
    - **Regressions [#]** : Number of regressions detected.
    - **Progressions [#]** : Number of progressions detected.
    - **Outliers [#]** : Number of outliers detected.

Tested VPP worker-thread-core combinations (1t1c, 2t2c, 4t4c) are listed
in separate tables in section 1.x. Followed by trending methodology in
section 2. and daily trending graphs in sections 3.x. Daily trending
data used for graphs is provided in sections 4.x.
