[Enc] Packet Encapsulations: Eth-IPv4 for IPv4 routing. [Cfg] DUT configuration: DUT1 is configured with IPv4 routing and two static IPv4 /24 route entries. DUT1 tested with Intel-XXV710. [Ver] TG veriffication: TG sends traffic at dynamically computed rate as PLRsearch algorithm gathers data and improves its estimate of a rate at which a prescribed small fraction of packets would be lost. After set time, the serarch stops and the algorithm reports its current estimate. Test packets are generated by TG on links to DUTs. TG traffic profile contains two L3 flow-groups (flow-group per direction, 253 flows per flow-group) with all packets containing Ethernet header, IPv4 header with IP protocol=61 and static payload. MAC addresses are matching MAC addresses of the TG node interfaces. [Ref] Applicable standard specifications: RFC2544.",
