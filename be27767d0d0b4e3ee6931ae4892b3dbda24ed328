That way you need no edits in current suites, and setup keywords remain maintainable.\n\nBut calling such Setup Suite Topology Interfaces keyword directly from suites (with \"no TG\" argument values specified in \"no TG\" suites; \"yes TG\" suites calling without arguments as before) is also good, at least if the values are short and descriptive (e.g. \"no_tg\u003d${True}\" if that also implies same link).",
