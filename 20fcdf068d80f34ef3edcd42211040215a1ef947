Ci-management Change for per-patch perf job which archives all (csit_current, csit_new, csit_parent).\n2. This Change\n3. Ci-management Change for per-patch job to archive new names only (csit_current, csit_parent). Plus whatever device per-patch job needs on ci-management side.\n\nFor Sandbox, I want to see both per-patch jobs running as after step 3.",
