| ... | 802.1ad tagging is applied on link between DUT1 and DUT2 with inner 4B
| ... | vlan tag (id=100) and outer 4B vlan tag (id=200).
| ... | *[Cfg] DUT configuration:* DUT1 and DUT2 are configured with L2 cross-
| ... | connect. DUT1 and DUT2 tested with 2p10GE NIC X520 Niantic by Intel.
| ... | *[Ver] TG verification:* In short performance tests, TG verifies
| ... | DUTs' throughput at ref-NDR (reference Non Drop Rate) with zero packet
| ... | loss tolerance. Ref-NDR value is periodically updated acording to
| ... | formula: ref-NDR = 0.9x NDR, where NDR is found in RFC2544 long
| ... | performance tests for the same DUT configuration. Test packets are
| ... | generated by TG on links to DUTs. TG traffic profile contains two L3
| ... | flow-groups (flow-group per direction, 253 flows per flow-group) with
| ... | all packets containing Ethernet header, IPv4 header with IP protocol=61
| ... | and static payload. MAC addresses are matching MAC addresses of the
| ... | TG node interfaces.
| ... | *[Ref] Applicable standard specifications:* RFC2544.
