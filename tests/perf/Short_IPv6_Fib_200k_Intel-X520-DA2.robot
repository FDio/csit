| ... | performance tests for the same DUT confiiguration. Test packets are
| ... | generated by TG on links to DUTs. TG traffic profile contains two L3
| ... | flow-groups (flow-group per direction, 100k flows per flow-group) with
| ... | all packets containing Ethernet header, IPv6 header and static
| ... | payload. Incrementing of IP.dst (IPv6 destination address) field is
