| ... | *[Cfg] DUT configuration:* Each DUT is configured with LISP and IPsec\
| ... | in each direction. IPsec is in transport mode. DUTs get IPv4 traffic\
| ... | from TG, encrypt it and send to another DUT, where packets are\
| ... | decrypted and sent back to TG.
| ... | *[Ver] TG verification:* TG finds and reports throughput NDR (Non Drop\
| ... | Rate) with zero packet loss tolerance or throughput PDR (Partial Drop\
| ... | Rate) with non-zero packet loss tolerance (LT) expressed in number\
| ... | of packets transmitted. NDR is discovered for different\
| ... | number of IPsec tunnels using binary search algorithms with configured\
| ... | starting rate and final step that determines throughput measurement\
| ... | resolution. Test packets are generated by TG on\
| ... | links to DUTs. TG traffic profile contains two L3 flow-groups\
| ... | (flow-group per direction, number of flows per flow-group equals to\
| ... | number of IPSec tunnels) with all packets\
| ... | containing Ethernet header, IPv4 header with IP protocol=61 and\
| ... | static payload. MAC addresses are matching MAC addresses of the TG\
| ... | node interfaces. Incrementing of IP.dst (IPv4 destination address)\
| ... | field is applied to both streams.
| ... | *[Ref] Applicable standard specifications:* RFC6830, RFC4303 and\
| ... | RFC2544.
