| ... | routing and two static IPv4 /24 route entries. Qemu Guest is connected
| ... | to VPP via vhost-user interfaces. Guest is running DPDK testpmd
| ... | interconnecting vhost-user interfaces using 3 cores pinned to cpu mask
| ... | 0xE0 and 2048M. Testpmd is using socket-mem=1024M (512x2M hugepages), 3

| ... | *[Ver] TG verification:* In short performance tests, TG verifies
| ... | DUTs' throughput at ref-NDR (reference Non Drop Rate) with zero packet
| ... | loss tolerance. Ref-NDR value is periodically updated acording to
| ... | formula: ref-NDR = 0.9x NDR, where NDR is found in RFC2544 long
| ... | performance tests for the same DUT configuration. Test packets are
| ... | generated by TG on links to DUTs. TG traffic profile contains two L3
| ... | flow-groups (flow-group per direction, 253 flows per flow-group) with
| ... | all packets containing Ethernet header, IPv4 header with IP protocol=61
| ... | and generated payload. MAC addresses are matching MAC addresses of the
| ... | TG node interfaces.
| ... | *[Ref] Applicable standard specifications:* RFC2544.
