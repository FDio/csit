| ... | DUTs' throughput at ref-NDR (reference Non Drop Rate) with zero packet
| ... | loss tolerance. Ref-NDR value is periodically updated acording to
| ... | formula: ref-NDR = 0.9x NDR, where NDR is found in RFC2544 long
| ... | performance tests for the same DUT configuration. Test packets are
| ... | generated by TG on links to DUTs. TG traffic profile contains two L3
| ... | flow-groups (flow-group per direction, 253 flows per flow-group) with
| ... | all packets containing Ethernet header, IPv6 header and static
| ... | payload. MAC addresses are matching MAC addresses of the TG node
| ... | interfaces.
