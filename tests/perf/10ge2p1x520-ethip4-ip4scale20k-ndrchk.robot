| ... | *[Cfg] DUT configuration:* DUT1 and DUT2 are configured with IPv4
| ... | routing and 2x10k static IPv4 /32 route entries. DUT1 and DUT2 tested
| ... | with 2p10GE NIC X520 Niantic by Intel.
| ... | *[Ver] TG verification:* In short performance tests, TG verifies
| ... | DUTs' throughput at ref-NDR (reference Non Drop Rate) with zero packet
| ... | loss tolerance. Ref-NDR value is periodically updated acording to
| ... | formula: ref-NDR = 0.9x NDR, where NDR is found in RFC2544 long
| ... | performance tests for the same DUT confiiguration. Test packets are
| ... | generated by TG on links to DUTs. TG traffic profile contains two L3
| ... | flow-groups (flow-group per direction, 10k flows per flow-group) with
| ... | all packets containing Ethernet header, IPv4 header with IP protocol=61
| ... | and static payload. Incrementing of IP.dst (IPv4 destination address)
| ... | field is applied to both streams.
| ... | *[Ref] Applicable standard specifications:* RFC2544.
