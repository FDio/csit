| ... | *[Cfg] DUT configuration:* DUT1 and DUT2 are configured with L2 bridge-
| ... | domain and MAC learning enabled. Qemu Guest is connected to VPP via
| ... | vhost-user interfaces. Guest is running DPDK testpmd interconnecting
| ... | vhost-user interfaces using 3 cores pinned to cpu mask 0xE0 and 2048M.
| ... | Testpmd is using socket-mem=1024M (512x2M hugepages), 3 cores (1 main
| ... | core and 2 cores dedicated for io), forwarding mode is set to io,

| ... | *[Ver] TG verification:* In short performance tests, TG verifies
| ... | DUTs' throughput at ref-NDR (reference Non Drop Rate) with zero packet
| ... | loss tolerance. Ref-NDR value is periodically updated acording to
| ... | formula: ref-NDR = 0.9x NDR, where NDR is found in RFC2544 long
| ... | performance tests for the same DUT confiiguration. Test packets are
| ... | generated by TG on links to DUTs. TG traffic profile contains two L3
| ... | flow-groups (flow-group per direction, 253 flows per flow-group) with
| ... | all packets containing Ethernet header, IPv4 header with IP protocol=61
| ... | and generated payload.
| ... | *[Ref] Applicable standard specifications:* RFC2544.
