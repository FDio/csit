| ... | *[Ver] TG verification:* TG finds and reports throughput NDR (Non Drop
| ... | Rate) with zero packet loss tolerance or throughput PDR (Partial Drop
| ... | Rate) with non-zero packet loss tolerance (LT) expressed in percentage
| ... | of packets transmitted. NDR and PDR are discovered for different
| ... | Ethernet L2 frame sizes using either binary search or linear search
| ... | algorithms with configured starting rate and final step that determines
| ... | throughput measurement resolution. Test packets are generated by TG on
| ... | links to DUTs. TG traffic profile contains two L3 flow-groups
| ... | (flow-group per direction, 253 flows per flow-group) with all packets
| ... | containing Ethernet header, IPv4 header with IP protocol=61 and static
| ... | payload. MAC addresses are matching MAC addresses of the TG node
| ... | interfaces.
