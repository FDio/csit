| Setup Global Variables

| | ... | Setup suite Variables. Variables are used across performance testing.
| |
| | ... | _NOTE:_ This KW sets following suite variables:
| | ... | - pre_stats - Statistics actions before traffic.
| | ... | - post_stats - Statistics actions after traffic.
| | ... | - pre_run_stats - Statistics actions during traffic before timer.
| | ... | - post_run_stats - Statistics actions during traffic after timer.
| | ... | - packages_dir - Path to directory where VPP packages are stored.
