| ... | *[Enc] Packet Encapsulations:* Eth-IPv4 for L2 switching of IPv4. 802.1q
| ... | tagging is applied on link between DUT1 and DUT2.
| ... | *[Cfg] DUT configuration:* DUT1 and DUT2 are configured with L2 bridge-
| ... | domain and MAC learning enabled. Qemu Guest is connected to VPP via
| ... | vhost-user interfaces. Guest is running DPDK testpmd interconnecting
| ... | vhost-user interfaces using 5 cores pinned to cpus 5-9 and 2048M
| ... | memory. Testpmd is using socket-mem=1024M (512x2M hugepages), 5 cores
| ... | (1 main core and 4 cores dedicated for io), forwarding mode is set to

| ... | Niantic by Intel.
| ... | *[Ver] TG verification:* TG verifies throughput PDR (Partial Drop
| ... | Rate) with non-zero packet loss tolerance (LT) expressed in percentage
| ... | of packets transmitted. Ref-PDR value is periodically updated acording to
| ... | formula: ref-PDR = 0.9x PDR, where PDR is found in RFC2544 long
| ... | performance tests for the same DUT configuration. Test packets are
| ... | generated by TG on links to DUTs. TG traffic profile contains two L3
| ... | flow-groups (flow-group per direction, 253 flows per flow-group) with
| ... | all packets containing Ethernet header, IPv4 header with IP protocol=61
| ... | and static payload. MAC addresses are matching MAC addresses of the
| ... | TG node interfaces.
| ... | *[Ref] Applicable standard specifications:* RFC2544.
