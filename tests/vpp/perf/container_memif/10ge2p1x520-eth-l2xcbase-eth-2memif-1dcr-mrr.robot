| ... | Container is connected to VPP via Memif interface. Container is running

| ... | *[Ver] TG verification:* In MaxReceivedRate test TG sends traffic
| ... | at line rate and reports total received/sent packets over trial period.
| ... | Test packets are generated by TG on links to DUTs. TG traffic profile
| ... | contains two L3 flow-groups (flow-group per direction, 254 flows per
| ... | flow-group) with all packets containing Ethernet header, IPv4 header
| ... | with IP protocol=61 and static payload. MAC addresses are matching MAC
| ... | addresses of the TG node interfaces.
