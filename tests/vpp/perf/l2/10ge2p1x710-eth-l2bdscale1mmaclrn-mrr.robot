| ... | Test packets are generated by TG on\
| ... | links to DUTs. TG traffic profile contains two L3 flow-groups\
| ... | (flow-group per direction, 500k flows per flow-group) with all packets\
| ... | containing Ethernet header, IPv4 header with IP protocol=61 and static\
| ... | payload. MAC addresses ranges are incremented as follows:
