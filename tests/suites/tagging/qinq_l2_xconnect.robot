*** Test Cases ***
| VPP can push and pop two VLAN tags to traffic transfering through xconnect
| | [Documentation] | Push two tags on DUT 1 to traffic sent from TG,
| | ...             | pop two tags on DUT 2 from this traffic
| | ...             | and receive untagged traffic on TG.
| | ...
| | Given Node path computed for 3-node topology
| | ... | ${nodes['TG']} | ${nodes['DUT1']} | ${nodes['DUT2']} | ${nodes['TG']}
| | And Interfaces in path are up
| | When VLAN subinterfaces initialized on 3-node topology
| | ... | ${dut1} | ${dut1_if2} | ${dut2} | ${dut2_if1} | ${subid}
| | ... | ${outer_vlan_id} | ${inner_vlan_id} | ${type_subif}
| | And L2 tag rewrite pop 2 tags setup on interfaces
| | ... | ${dut1} | ${subif_index_1} | ${dut2} | ${subif_index_2}
| | ... | ${tag_rewrite_method}
| | And Interfaces and VLAN sub-interfaces inter-connected using L2-xconnect
| | ... | ${dut1} | ${dut1_if1} | ${subif_index_1}
| | ... | ${dut2} | ${dut2_if2} | ${subif_index_2}
| | Then Send and receive ICMPv4 | ${tg} | ${tg_if1} | ${tg_if2}
