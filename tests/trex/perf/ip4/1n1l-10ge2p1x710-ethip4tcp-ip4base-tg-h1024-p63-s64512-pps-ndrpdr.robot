| ... | with single links between.
| ... | *[Enc] Packet Encapsulations:* Eth-IPv4 for L1 cross connect patch.
| ... | *[Ver] TG verification:* TG finds and reports throughput NDR (Non Drop\
| ... | Rate) with zero packet loss tolerance and throughput PDR (Partial Drop\
| ... | Rate) with non-zero packet loss tolerance (LT) expressed in percentage\
| ... | of packets transmitted. NDR and PDR are discovered for different\
| ... | Ethernet L2 frame sizes using MLRsearch library.\
| ... | Test packets are generated by TG on links to TG.\
| ... | TG traffic profile contains client and server ASTF programs,\
| ... | generating packets containing Ethernet header, IPv4 header,\
| ... | TCP header and static payload.\
| ... | MAC addresses are matching MAC addresses of the TG node interfaces.
| ... | *[Ref] Applicable standard specifications:* RFC2544.
