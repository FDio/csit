| ... | - **[Enc] Packet Encapsulations:** Eth-IPv4 for L1 cross connect patch.
| ... |
| ... | - **[Ver] TG verification:** TG finds and reports throughput NDR (Non \
| ... | Drop Rate) with zero packet loss tolerance and throughput PDR \
| ... | (Partial Drop Rate) with non-zero packet loss tolerance (LT) \
| ... | expressed in percentage of packets transmitted. NDR and PDR are \
| ... | discovered for different Ethernet L2 frame sizes using MLRsearch \
| ... | library.
| ... | Test packets are generated by TG on links to TG. \
| ... | TG traffic profile contains two L3 flow-groups (flow-group per \
| ... | direction, 500k flows per flow-group) with all packets containing \
| ... | Ethernet header, IPv4 header with IP protocol=61 and static payload. \
| ... | MAC addresses ranges are incremented as follows:
