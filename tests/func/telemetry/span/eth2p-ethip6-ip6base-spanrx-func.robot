| TC01: DUT mirrors IPv6 packets from one interface to another
| | [Documentation]
| | ... | [Top] TG=DUT1
| | ... | [Cfg] On DUT1 configure IPv6 address, add ARP entry for one TG \
| | ... | interface and set SPAN mirroring from one DUT interface to the other.
| | ... | [Ver] Make TG send an ICMP packet to DUT through one interface,\
| | ... | then receive a copy of sent packet and of DUT's ICMP reply\
| | ... | on the other interface.
