*** Test Cases ***
| TC01: DUT1 and DUT2 with L2XC switch ICMPv4 between two TG links
| | [Documentation]
| | ... | [Top] TG-DUT1-DUT2-TG. [Enc] Eth-IPv4-ICMPv4. [Cfg] On DUT1 and \
| | ... | DUT2 configure L2 cross-connect (L2XC), each with one interface
| | ... | to TG and one Ethernet interface towards the other DUT. [Ver]
| | ... | Make TG send ICMPv4 Echo Req in both directions between two of
| | ... | its interfaces to be switched by DUT1 and DUT2; verify all
| | ... | packets are received. [Ref]
| | Given Path for 3-node testing is set
| | ... | ${nodes['TG']} | ${nodes['DUT1']} | ${nodes['DUT2']} | ${nodes['TG']}
