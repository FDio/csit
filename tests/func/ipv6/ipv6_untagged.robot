| ... | topology TG - DUT1 - DUT2 - TG with one link between the nodes. DUT1 and
| ... | DUT2 are configured with IPv6 routing and static routes. Test ICMPv6
| ... | Echo Request packets are sent in both directions by TG on links to DUT1
| ... | and DUT2 and received on TG links on the other side of circular
| ... | topology. On receive TG verifies packets IPv6 src-addr, dst-addr and MAC
