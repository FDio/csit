*** Test Cases ***
| TC01: IPv6 Equal-cost multipath routing
| | [Documentation]
| | ... | [Top] TG=DUT
| | ... | [Cfg] On DUT configure multipath routing wiht two equal-cost paths.
| | ... | [Ver] TG sends 100 IPv6 ICMP packets traffic on the first link to\
| | ... | DUT. On second link to TG verify if traffic is divided into two paths.
| | Given Configure path in 2-node circular topology
| | ... | ${nodes['TG']} | ${nodes['DUT1']} | ${nodes['TG']}
| | And Set interfaces in 2-node circular topology up
| | And Vpp Set If Ipv6 Addr | ${dut_node}
| | ... | ${dut_to_tg_if2} | ${ip_1} | ${prefix_length}
| | And Vpp Set If Ipv6 Addr | ${dut_node}
| | ... | ${dut_to_tg_if1} | ${ip_2} | ${prefix_length}
| | And Add Ip Neighbor
| | ... | ${dut_node} | ${dut_to_tg_if1} | ${neighbor_1_ip} | ${neighbor_1_mac}
| | And Add Ip Neighbor
| | ... | ${dut_node} | ${dut_to_tg_if1} | ${neighbor_2_ip} | ${neighbor_2_mac}
