      "message": "\u003e Why are we doing this?\n\nGood question. I guess this requirement had sense when the level of documentation (type and meaning of arguments and return values) were of lower quality than today.\n\nPersonally, if you contribute a change that removes the \"A keyword usage example SHALL be the part of the Documentation.\" item from docs/test_code_guidelines.rst\nI would give it +1, but I can imagine Jan having a different opinion.\nProbably worth a discussion on csit-dev (so that people who actually read the generated documentation can chime in).\n\nUntil the item is removed, I prefer to follow the guidelines as currently written.",
