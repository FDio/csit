      "message": "To see real hardware counters, hardware information (like rss, number of rxq/txq/txd/rxd, and lots of others, CRC errors) but we are not using them currently. Then show hardware is reporting driver counters (DPDK) which are very useful, but with RDMA and AVF and all other internal interfaces there is no useful output at all. I am more wondering if this is bug in VPP or laziness of vpp-dev to add the full HW info. \n(note: similar to trex stats vs xstats)",
