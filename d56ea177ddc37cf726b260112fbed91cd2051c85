      "message": "I like distinguishing _FLAGS from _JOBS for now.\nJenkins run can show env values, so this is more a convenience, or a debug (to confirm the value was really forwarded and not lost when calling from a parent script).\n\n\u003e print the whole env instead\n\nThat sounds like a security violation. Some jobs set environment variables with special names to store passwords and other sensitive stuff. The aforementioned \"Jenkins run can show env values\" knows not to show them. I know from [1] an example of such a secure variable. Its name starts with SECURE_, but I am not sure that is sufficient.\n\n[1] https://gerrit.fd.io/r/c/ci-management/+/27414",
