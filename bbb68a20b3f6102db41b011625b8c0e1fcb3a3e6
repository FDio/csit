Perhaps we can add Label \"Csit-Verified\" (and teach the crc check job to set that, and teach Gerrit to hide the submit button if it is -1)?\n\nBefore that, I think it is better to merge the text as it is here, and leave it to the contributors to figure out how to draw committer attention to their patch.\n\n[0] https://gerrit.fd.io/r/admin/repos/All-Projects,access",
