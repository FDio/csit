# Idea of this file is motivated by OpenDylight,
# especially its Integration/Test sub-project.

# This file requires active virtualenv with tox package installed,
# or python-tox system package installed.

# Usage:
# cd to CSIT root (other directories might use different tox.ini)
#   $ tox
# will execute all checks.
#  $ tox -e pylint
# will execute only checks defined in "pylint" tox environment.

# TODO: Tox prints various warnings.
#   Figure out what they are about and fix them.

# It would be possible to add a check which fails
# if number of long lines increases (from parent commit value),
# and have it voting.
# But that would basically prevent us from adding new suites righ now. :(
