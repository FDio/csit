# Idea of this file is motivated by OpenDylight,
# especially its Integration/Test sub-project.

# This file requires active virtualenv with tox package installed,
# or python-tox system package installed.

# Usage:
# cd to CSIT root (other directories might use different tox.ini)
#   $ tox
# will execute all checks.
#  $ tox -e pylint
# will execute only checks defined in "pylint" tox environment.
