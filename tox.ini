# Idea of this file is motivated by OpenDylight,
# especially its Integration/Test sub-project.

# This file requires active virtualenv with tox package installed,
# or python-tox system package installed.

# Usage:
# cd to CSIT root (other directories might use different tox.ini)
#   $ tox
# will execute all default checkers.
#  $ tox -e pylint
# will execute only checkers (or fixers) defined in "pylint" tox environment.

[tox]
# Fast and brief checkers to front, slow or verbose checkers to back.
envlist = copyright_year, gpl_license, new_line_length, line_length, autogen,
  pylint

# The following is needed as tox requires setup.py by default.
skipsdist = true
# Just a shorthand to avoid long lines.
script_dir = ./resources/libraries/bash/entry/tox

# Recommended ordering withinn testenv definition:
# + General comments.
# + ignore_outcome for non-voting checkers,
# + setenv (PYTHONPATH) for Python-using checkers and fixers.
# + Other Python stuff (e.g. basepython and deps for pylint).
# + whitelist_externals to enable bash.
# + Commands with a single bash to launch the corresponding script.
