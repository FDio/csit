# Idea of this file is motivated by OpenDylight,
# especially its Integration/Test sub-project.

# This file requires active virtualenv with tox package installed,
# or python-tox system package installed.

# Usage:
# cd to CSIT root (other directories might use different tox.ini)
#   $ tox
# will execute all checks.
#  $ tox -e pylint
# will execute only checks defined in "pylint" tox environment.

# TODO: Create voting checker against tags not in tag_documentation.rst file.

# TODO: Create .yaml specific checker, so people can override long line check.
# TODO: Create .rst specific checker, if there is one allowing

# TODO: You get the idea, replace line check with something smarter
