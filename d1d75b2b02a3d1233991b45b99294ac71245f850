      "message": "Before I start commenting on other parts, I am interested whether we can run such new tests in FD.io lab, as a verify job.\nThe complete verify job will need to obtain such .deb files.\nFor that you need to add new logic to this file [0], or maybe create an analogue of this function [1].\n\nAs the current code in ci-management is hardcoded to support only CSIT jobs with VPP [2] or DPDK [3], you will also need a contribution to ci-management. For testing such a contribution on sandbox [4], see [5]. If you are lacking rights to use FD.io sandbox, I can create jobs there and run them, once your ci-management Change is in Gerrit.\n\n[0] https://github.com/FDio/csit/blob/master/resources/libraries/bash/function/gather.sh\n[1] https://github.com/FDio/csit/blob/3111f250640b2f0364bd62104416ada41098b280/resources/libraries/bash/function/per_patch.sh#L67-L89\n[2] https://github.com/FDio/ci-management/blob/b082bcf3bf0ccd29d0356b4b11537887eee30e0c/jjb/csit/csit-perf.yaml#L118-L119\n[3] https://github.com/FDio/ci-management/blob/b082bcf3bf0ccd29d0356b4b11537887eee30e0c/jjb/csit/csit-perf.yaml#L449-L450\n[4] https://jenkins.fd.io/sandbox/\n[5] https://docs.releng.linuxfoundation.org/en/latest/jenkins-sandbox.html",
