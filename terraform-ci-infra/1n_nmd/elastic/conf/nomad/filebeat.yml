#=========================== Filebeat inputs =============================

# List of inputs to fetch data.
filebeat.inputs:

#------------------------------ Log input --------------------------------
- type: log
  enabled: true

  # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
  # To fetch all ".log" files from a specific level of subdirectories
  # /var/log/*/*.log can be used.
  # For each file found under this path, a harvester is started.
  # Make sure not file is defined twice as this can lead to unexpected behaviour.
  paths:
    - /var/log/syslog
    - /var/log/*.log

#------------------------------ Container input --------------------------------
- type: container
  enabled: false

  # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
  # To fetch all ".log" files from a specific level of subdirectories
  # /var/log/*/*.log can be used.
  # For each file found under this path, a harvester is started.
  # Make sure not file is defined twice as this can lead to unexpected behaviour.
